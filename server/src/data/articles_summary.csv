782fdb4e370e08d58dcd681f5f0041aa58628239,"**A Labor MP has demanded Prime Minister Tony Abbott provides evidence that he is no longer a British citizen.**

Terri Butler, MP for Griffith in Queensland, questioned the PM over whether he is still a dual citizen after being contacted 'on numerous occasions on social media' by blogger Tony Magrathea, from the Sunshine Coast.

**Mr Abbott was born in London, England, in 1957 to an Australian mother and English father and came to Australia in 1960 as an assisted migrant.**

He applied for Australian citizenship in 1981, becoming a dual citizen of Australia and Britain, and then reportedly – on an undisclosed date – renounced his British citizenship.

**If Mr Abbott is still a British citizen he would not be eligible to be Prime Minister.**

Labor MP Terri Butler has written a letter to Prime Minister Tony Abbott asking him about his citizenship.

The PM was born in London, England, in 1957 to an Australian mother and English father.

Mr Magrathea is said to have emailed politicians across the country asking them if they were purposely staying quiet about the PM allegedly being a dual citizen, Independent Australia reports.

**The blogger previously reportedly submitted a Freedom of Information request to the Prime Minister's office and the British Home Office seeking a copy of Mr Abbott’s RN form.**

The form is used by British subjects to renounce their citizenship.

As part of the Australian constitution, people who hold dual citizenship are not permitted to stand for election to Federal Parliament.

In his email to MPs, Mr Magrathea wrote:

‘The Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet declared in an FOI request, 2014-159, in October last year, that Mr Abbott is still a dual citizen of Britain and Australia.’

Ms Butler is thought to be the only MP who responded to Mr Magrathea’s email.

She promised to write to Mr Abbott and ask him to provide the requested RN form as evidence.

**Ms Butler sent the letter on Friday and asked him to provide Mr Magarathea 'with a copy of the declaration of renunciation' that he received when he renounced his British citizenship.**

In her letter to the Mr Abbott on Friday, Ms Butler wrote:

‘I have received an email from a Mr Tony Magarthea who asserts that you have yet to renounce your British citizenship, I enclose my response to Mr Magrathea.

‘I make no claim that you are ineligible to sit in the House of Representatives, that your election was void, or that you have failed to renounce your British citizenship. I have seen no evidence that would satisfy me of any such claim(s).

‘However, I also have no desire to continue to receive, and respond to, communications questioning your eligibility under section 44(i) of the Constitution.

‘For that reason, I believe it would assist if you would provide Mr Magrathea with a copy of the declaration of renunciation that you received after renouncing your citizenship. Alternatively, it would assist if you would advise the date of your renunciation. ‘Thank you, in advance, for considering this letter.’

However, a spokesperson for Ms Butler told Daily Mail Australia the MP believes ‘it’s a non-issue’.

He confirmed Ms Butler has not received a response yet, but highlighted the letter was ‘only posted on Friday.’

‘Terri’s got no view on Tony’s citizenship,’ the spokesperson said.

‘He’d [Tony Magrathea] contacted her on numerous occasions on social media and she was just making sure the guy got some sort of reply,’ he explained.

‘Terri believes the battleground with the LNP is on policy and ideology not on citizenship, she’d be highly surprised if he wasn’t a citizen in the 2013 election… she won’t be taking any further action. ‘She was just making sure this guy got a reply from a parliamentary representative, she doesn’t think it is an issue or ever was an issue.

**Mr Abbott (centre) applied for Australian citizenship in 1981, becoming a dual citizen of Australia and Britain, and studied at Oxford University in England.**

The PM's office previously denied that Mr Abbott (right, next to British Prime Minister David Cameron) is still a dual citizen.

‘She stated clearly in her letter we should be focusing on policy and not citizenship issues.’

Her request was denied by Robert McMahon, the Assistant Secretary of the Parliamentary and Government Branch, because 'no documents relevant to the request are in the possession of the Department'.

The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet said 'no relevant documents were found' when they searched for them.

Also in September, NineMsn were told by the Prime Minister's Office and the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet that Mr Abbott has renounced his British Citizenship.

‘The Prime Minister is an Australian citizen and does not hold citizenship of any other country,’ the Department reportedly said.","MP Terri Butler wrote to the Prime Minister on Friday .

*By Ashley Collman*

PUBLISHED: 09:40 EST, 13 September 2013 | UPDATED: 14:43 EST, 13 September 2013

When it comes to bikini competition day, the harshest judges are the beauty queens themselves. Sources told the New York Post that Miss New York Nina Davuluri called current Miss America Mallory Hagan 'fat as [expletive]'.

After winning the Miss New York competition on July 16, Ms Davuluri invited friends back to her hotel room to celebrate, and that's when another competitor overheard her slinging insults at Ms Hagan.

**Harsh: Sources tell the New York Post that the current Miss New York called Miss America Mallory Hagan 'fat as [expletive]'.**

Above, Ms Hagan competing in the Miss America pageant last January

Frenemies: Mallory Hagan, left, and Nina Davuluri, right, competed with each other in the Miss New York competition the year that Ms Hagan won, and Ms Davuluri was second runner-up

Catty: A fellow beauty queen says she overheard Miss New York Nina Davuluri, right, calling Miss America Mallory Hagan, left, 'fat as [expletive]'

When the conversation turned offensive, a beauty queen in an adjoining room started to record the conversation. In addition to the fat comment, friends of Ms Davuluri can be heard making racist comments.

Ms Davuluri is the first Indian-American to serve as Miss New York and has nicknamed herself 'Miss Diversity'.

**Celebration: Nina Davuluri was crowned Miss New York on July 16.**

After her win, she invited friends back to her hotel room to celebrate and that's when another competitor overheard her make the fat comment.

'Miss Diversity': Ms Davuluri was the first Indian-American to win the Miss New York title, but friends in her hotel room were overheard making racist comments

Following the incident, Ms Davuluri apologized for her friends' comments on Facebook, but said she did nothing wrong.

'I want to apologize for the awful statements made by people in my room...There were people who claimed to be my supporters and said things I never agreed with, nor supported,' Ms Davuluri wrote. 'I was never a part of the words or statements that may have been hurtful...I'm sorry if someone said something that was inappropriate.'

A representative for Ms Hagan said that the situation was investigated in July and that there is 'no validity to the story whatsoever'.

'Miss New York spoke to Mallory Hagan to let her know there was no validity and to apologize if she was offended in any way,' the rep said.

Ms Hagan was photographed on a beach in Hawaii this past spring, having put on a few pounds since being crowned Miss America. She addressed her weight gain on Anderson Cooper Live saying:

'Well you know I think that I am human I like to equate getting ready for the Miss America pageant to getting ready for a boxing match. We get in shape and then afterwords life goes back to normal.'

Post-competition: Pictures taken of Ms Hagan on vacation in Hawaii last March show that she's filled out a little since the competition

She stressed that being healthy is all about balance.

'It's all about being healthy, we're all about living a healthy lifestyle. Some days you want to eat potatoes and some days you don't.'

And Ms Davuluri herself wasn't always as svelte as she looked in last Tuesday's swimsuit competition.

The Central New Yorker told the Syracuse Post-Standard that she was 60 pounds heavier during her final semesters at the University of Michigan and struggled with bulimia.

Her own weight issues: Ms Davuluri says she was about 60 pounds heavier during her final semesters at University of Michigan, and that she has struggled with bulimia in the past

One day she looked at a picture of herself and finally realized just how much weight she had put on. She thought to herself:

'This is not who I want to be, and it is not the way I want to portray myself to the world.'

So upon entering the beauty pageant world, she got a personal trainer and started eating healthy.

She said she doesn't give out her weight, fearing that other women would try to make that their goal. However, she says her current weight is hardly what she'd define as 'skinny'.

Not skinny: Ms Davuluri doesn't give out her weight for fear that other women will use it as a goal. She says her current weight is hardly what she'd define as 'skinny'

Both Ms Hagan and Ms Davuluri competed against each other in the Miss New York competition, with Ms Hagan being crowned Miss America last year.

The new Miss America will be crowned this Sunday.","Nina Davuluri, Miss New York, was overheard last July calling Miss America Mallory Hagan 'fat as [expletive]'

After the incident, Ms. Davuluri apologized for the racist comments but denied making any herself.

## A Metal Detectorist's Discovery
An elaborate 300-year-old ring, discovered in mud in a maize field, has been officially classified as treasure.

### The Ring's History Unfolds
Metal detectorist Ron Pitman, of Swansea, found the gold and silver ring on farmland in Gower. The ring’s outer surface is engraved with a trellis-style pattern, while its inner surface is inscribed with the words 'prepared bee to follow me’.

## Dating the Ring
The extra e in ‘be’ was said to have been a common feature during the mid to late 1600s. This led experts to believe that the ring was made during this time period.

### The Discovery Story
Metal detectorist Ron Pitman, of Swansea, found the gold and silver ring (pictured) in 2010. The ring’s outer surface is engraved with a trellis-style pattern, while its inner surface is inscribed with ‘prepared bee to follow me’. Mr. Pitman discovered the ring in a field used to grow maize that had been ploughed and rolled, in October 2010.

## Technical Details
The ring is said to be made up of around 81 per cent gold and 9 per silver. It resembles a mourning ring, which was a type of jewelry popular during the Middle Ages.

### Mourning Rings: A Brief History
Reports of mourning rings were first seen during the Middle Ages, but became more common during the 17th century. The estimated value of the ring was not disclosed, but Mr Pitman will receive a finder’s fee. This fee, will also be split with the landowners.

## Expert Analysis
Mark Redknapp of the Department of Archaeology and Numismatics at the National Museum in Cardiff who examined the ring, said: ‘Such rings can be difficult to date but the decoration and sentiments in this case suggests a 17th rather than 18th century date. 

### The Ring's Significance
‘It is my opinion that as an object which has at least 10 per cent by weight precious metal which is at least 300 years old. ‘The ring therefore is treasure.’

## Additional Context
There have been previous examples of rings found in the UK with similar engravings, such as ‘Wee part to meete’, dated to 1658.

### The Ring's Resemblance to a Fictional Work
The Gower ring also bears a resemblance to the fictional ring seen in the Lord of the Rings (pictured).

## New Ownership
The 17th century jewellery was officially classified as treasure at a hearing in Swansea earlier today, and is now the property of the Crown.

### A Potential Future Home
The acting coroner said Swansea Museum has since expressed an interest in bidding for the ring.","The ring’s outer surface is engraved with a trellis-style pattern .

Wellington Gavin and Erickson Villa left school Friday afternoon to play in Starlight Park when the tragic accident happened. Villa was allegedly the first to jump in, and didn't know how to swim. His cousin jumped after to help him, but struggled in the currents as well.

Too young: **Erickson Villa, 13 (left)**, drowned in the Bronx River on Friday. His cousin Wellington Gavin, 13 (right), died Sunday after jumping into the river to save the struggling relative.

Emergency responders arrived on the scene around 3:14pm, at which point the boys had been in the water for roughly 30 minutes. One boy was removed at 3:37pm, followed by the other nearly an hour later. Both were unconscious when they were pulled from the water. Villa died that day while Gavin initially improved at Children's Center Montefiore Hospital. However, by Sunday his conditioned worsened so much that his mother was preparing to take him off life support. Gavin's heart stopped on its own before life support was taken away.

Emergency responders arrived on the scene at 3:14pm and pulled one of the boy's bodies out about **20 minutes later**. The other boy was pulled out an hour after that. Both were unconscious when they were pulled from the water. Gavin was rushed to the hospital but his condition deteriorated by Sunday and his heart stopped beating.

Gavin's family have been speaking to the public through their church pastor, Rev Joel Bauza. On Sunday, Rev Bauza announced Gavin's untimely passing and said they his family had decided to donate his organs to science as a tribute to his 'act of heroism'. Rev Bauza also said the family hopes top protect other children from falling prey to the river.

While there are signs showing that swimming is prohibited in that part of the park, new boat docks have become a favorite gathering spot of the neighborhood's children. '**The family has a lot of concerns about the park safety and they want to address that**,' Rev Bauza said.

8b49d60d388b2f560cf29e6c0a621f062213e461,"**President Barack Obama on Sunday urged Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to agree to an 'immediate, unconditional humanitarian ceasefire' with Hamas.**

The White House says Obama expressed 'strong condemnation' of Hamas' attacks on Israel and again supported Israel's right to defend herself but implored Netanyahu to abide by a permanent ceasefire between his country and the terrorist group.

**Obama's call with the world leader followed Israel's rejection on Friday of a new ceasefire agreement with Hamas negotiated by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry.**

Afterward, an Israeli news report quoted 'voices' from the latter leader's cabinet describing Kerry as 'completely capitulating' to Hamas and 'negligent,' and a top Israeli journalist compared Kerry to a space alien - characterizations that had the Obama administration 'fuming' on Monday, according to the Associated Press.

**The White House is none too happy with deprecating comments made over the weekend by Israeli ministers about Secretary of State John Kerry's negotiating skills.**

In a post on liberal news publication Haaretz's website over the weekend, diplomatic correspondent Barack Ravid said Kerry did more to 'thwart the possibility of reaching a cease-fire in Gaza' than he did to promote one.

He went on to say Kerry would be 'responsible for every additional drop of blood that is spilled' if his actions resulted in an escalation of Israeli military aggression.

**'Kerry isn’t anti-Israeli; on the contrary, he’s a true friend to Israel,' Ravid wrote.**

**Fighting resumed between Israel and Hamas on Sunday morning as the clock ran out on a temporary ceasefire that put the nearly three weeks old armed conflict on hold for a half day.**

Appearing on CNN's State of the Union on Sunday morning, Netanyahu reaffirmed his country's refusal of Hamas' ultimatum and chastised his enemies' violation of previously agreed upon ceasefires.

**'Israel is doing what any country would do, and certainly what the U.S. would do,' Netanyahu said.**

The White House says Obama called the Israeli Prime Minster that afternoon and told him 'ultimately' a long-term solution 'must ensure the disarmament of terrorist groups and the demilitarization of Gaza.'

**However, the White House says Obama shared the administration's 'serious and growing concern about the rising number of Palestinian civilian deaths and the loss of Israeli lives, as well as the worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza.'**

As of Sunday, more than a thousand Palestinians had been killed in the conflict and up to 6,000 others had been injured, according to AP.

Nearly four dozen Israeli soldiers and three civilians have also been killed.

**In excerpts of an interview with Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal that aired on CBS on Sunday and Monday, Meshaal told Charlie Rose that 'the world has two choices' - to help Hamas 'peacefully' remove Israel from the West Bank and the Gaza strip or 'we will expel this occupation from our land.'**

**Hamas will keep fighting the 'occupiers,' he said, until it is victorious.**

'I can die because of Israel. I cannot live under the occupation. The occupation is the worst thing that you can ever imagine,' he said.

'So every single Palestinian can die for the next generations to live in peace and freedom.'

**Mashaal danced around whether Hamas would 'coexist with the state of Israel' if Palestine had its own state before telling Rose, 'When we have a Palestinian state, then the Palestinian state will decide on its policies,' adding that the 'Palestinian people can have their say, when they have their own state, without occupation.'**

United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon said today that both Netanyahu and Mashaal were responsible for the conflict.

**The U.N. Human Rights report is a joke,** said Senator Graham in comments reported by Politico.

'The U.N. is becoming anti-Israeli, anti-Semitic.'

**Will they ever forgive him?: One Israeli journalist compared Kerry to a space alien after he failed to successfully negotiate a permanent ceasefire between Israel and Hamas last week.**

Throughout Israel it was Secretary Kerry who was the subject of mockery in weekend commentary.

Maariv columnist Ben Caspit called Kerry 'an ongoing embarrassment, with the characteristics of a snowball.'

'The further he rolls, the greater the embarrassment,' Caspit said.

**Israeli TV reporter Udi Segal ran a report citing government officials who framed Kerry as 'incapable of handling the most basic matters.'**

The Associated Press said Monday that Obama administration officials said on background that by ridiculing Kerry, Israeli ministers 'crossed a line' and relations between Israel and the U.S. may never be as close as it once was as a result.

**In on the record comments Deputy National Security Adviser Tony Blinken came to Kerry's defense.**

'Israel has no better friend, no stronger defender than John Kerry,' he told AP.

The comments about Kerry are 'people leaking things that are either misinformed, or attempting to misinform,' he claimed.","Obama wants Israel to agree to an 'immediate, unconditional humanitarian ceasefire' with Hamas .

UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon joined Obama in calling for an immediate humanitarian cease-fire, saying both Netanyahu and Hamas were morally wrong for allowing the death and destruction to continue. Over 1,000 Palestinians have been killed, and nearly four dozen Israeli soldiers and civilians have also died in the conflict."

**Donations Soar to £1.5million**

The donations to a fund set up to help rebuild the home soared to nearly £1.5 million, boosted by a pledge of £25,000 from X Factor guru Simon Cowell. The money was raised despite some controversy surrounding a joke made by Coronation Street actor Jack P Shepherd about the fire on Twitter.

830ddcd1e1bbb14e0b069b7c738b8387e3671419,"**Brian Williams Steps Down from NBC Nightly News Amid Scandal**

Brian Williams has announced that he is temporarily stepping down as anchor of the NBC Nightly News. The 55-year-old Managing Editor made the announcement in a statement on Saturday, citing concerns that he has become ""too much a part of the news"" due to his recent controversies.

**Controversy Unfolds Over False Story**

Williams' decision comes after it was revealed that he had fabricated a story about being on a helicopter that was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade in Iraq in 2003. He had previously claimed that the aircraft he was on was struck, but later recanted his account after veterans who were actually on the chopper called him out.

**Other Scandals Emerge**

Williams has also been accused of fabricating elements of his time reporting from New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina. He claimed to have seen a body floating down the street and contracted dysentery from flood water, but these claims have been met with skepticism.

**Lester Holt to Take Over**

In light of the scandal, Lester Holt will be taking over as anchor of the NBC Nightly News for the next several days. Holt has previously covered for Williams on occasion, including when he was having knee surgery in 2013.

**Internal Probe Launched**

NBC has launched an internal probe into Williams' actions, led by top investigative journalist Richard Esposito. The network is also facing scrutiny from rival ABC, which is reportedly reviewing old footage of Williams to see if there are any other instances where he fabricated stories.

**Katie Couric Eyes Return to NBC**

Former NBC anchor Katie Couric has been mentioned as a potential replacement for Williams in the future. Couric currently anchors Yahoo! Global News and has deep contacts within NBC.

**Lester Holt's Background**

Lester Holt, who is taking over as anchor of the NBC Nightly News, has a long history with the network. He began his career at CBS in 1981 and joined NBC in 2005, where he became a substitute anchor for the Nightly News and Today show.

**Holt's Past Mistakes**

Despite his current success, Holt has not been immune to mistakes in the past. In 2012, he overslept and had to be woken up by an executive producer before going on air with the Weekend Today show. He also got lost on a train ride during coverage of the London Olympics and ended up in Scotland.

**Holt's Experience**

Holt has covered major events for NBC, including the London Olympics and the Sochi Winter Olympics. In 2014, he downed a shot of vodka with co-host Natalie Morales while covering the Sochi games. Despite these experiences, Holt remains confident in his abilities to anchor the Nightly News.

**Timeline**

A bomb squad was forced to blow up a wartime explosive in a field after discovering a cache of guns, ammunition, and grenades in a man's garage this morning. Army experts were called to the semi-detached house in St Albans, Hertfordshire, this evening after police sealed off the property having discovered the hoard of historic weaponry.

A planned explosion was carried out in a nearby field as a 48-year-old man, named locally as Alan Tissington, was arrested on suspicion of stealing from a prisoner of war camp in the UK. Bomb disposal robots were sent into the home this morning where police found a vast collection of war memorabilia including guns, artillery shells, mortar bombs, gas masks and uniforms from the First and Second World Wars.

Police who raided a house in a Hertfordshire street found a cache of firearms and ammunition in the garage. After the raid, police laid out some of the firearms and ammunition they had found at the man's house.

Arranged against the far wall of the garage housing the memorabilia was a collection of artillery shells. Army experts carried out a controlled explosion in a field near the house this afternoon in St Albans. Hertfordshire Police confirmed a number of detonations were carried out this afternoon in the field.

Forensics experts worked to catalogue the munitions they found, which included bullets and rifles. A garage behind the property stored a treasure trove of memorabilia - and munitions - from the world wars. A man, 46, was arrested on suspicion of theft of explosives before bomb disposal robots went into his house.

Police and army officers were accompanied by experts from English Heritage as they searched the house, outbuildings and garden. Hertfordshire Police, who insisted the raid was not terrorism-related, said it may be necessary to remain at the house for up to 48 hours as they carry out work to establish the safety of the devices found today.

Chief Inspector Ken Townsend, of Hertfordshire Police, said: 'This seizure is on an unprecedented scale and it will be a long process. It is an extremely large collection. Although the items seized today are potentially dangerous, there is no danger to members of the public.'

Officers suspect the man of illegally metal detecting on sites of historic importance, including a former Second World War PoW camp in Batford, near Harpenden. It is a criminal offence to retrieve artefacts from the ground after finding them with a metal detector if the land is a protected site or without permission of the landowner.

The large camp was home to around 600 prisoners of war, most of them Italian or German, until around 1947. Hertfordshire Police said they had intelligence to suggest that the man living at the property with his family had been building up a collection of WW1 and WW2 artefacts. Officers believe the man, who neighbours described as a military enthusiast, had travelled to sites all over Britain and Europe in the search for memorabilia.

Hand grenades, shell covers, incendiary bombs, and stick grenades were among the munitions discovered.

Dozens of police officers, accompanied by army bomb disposal experts and sniffer dogs filled the street. The garage contained a vast collection of memorabilia including uniforms, gas masks, helmets and wreaths.

The firearms were found in a garage to the side of the semi-detached house after today's early morning raid. This Vicker's belt-fed machine gun was among the items seized by police at the house in St Albans today.

## Wenger Concerned About Striker's Long-Term Injury

Arsene Wenger fears that Olivier Giroud will be ruled out until the New Year, leaving Arsenal to consider a late plunge into the transfer market before Monday’s deadline. 

### A Freak Injury

Wenger tried to push concerns aside to avoid distractions ahead of Wednesday’s Champions League play-off second leg against Besiktas but admitted Giroud could face a long time out after a freak injury.

The striker was hurt when the ball smashed into the sole of his boot in the final seconds of Saturday’s 2-2 draw at Everton, pushing the toe-end of the foot upwards towards the shin, causing a small fracture near his ankle.

Giroud went down with an ankle injury late on against Everton on Saturday. 

### Firepower: Giroud Scores Arsenal's Equaliser

Firepower: Giroud scored Arsenal's equaliser in the hard-fought 2-2 draw with Everton on Saturday.

## ‘I Still Don’t Understand How He Did It’

‘I still don’t understand how he did it,’ said Arsenal manager Wenger. ‘The problem I think is his tibia. He over-stretched his ankle that way. It was on the ball, not a contact.

Giroud will be assessed again by a specialist on Wednesday but when asked if it looked like a long-term injury, Wenger replied: ‘It can be, we’ll see. It’s sad for us, but for the moment we are focused on this game. 

### We Have Started the Season Quite Well

We have started the season quite well, with three good games. We want to continue to grow and win our games.’

## Arsenal Without Captain Mikel Arteta

Arsenal are also without captain Mikel Arteta, who twisted an ankle in the goalless first leg and influential midfielder Aaron Ramsey, who is banned after a red card in Istanbul.

Kieran Gibbs has a hamstring problem and Theo Walcott, out since January with a knee injury, will not be rushed back, with both set to return after next month’s international break.","Arsenal face Besiktas on Wednesday in Champions League play-off second leg at the Emirates after 0-0 draw in Turkey last week .

## Sophie Walton, 21, from Upminster in Havering, was diagnosed with bone cancer in 2011.

*By Lizzie Parry for MailOnline*

Sophie Walton took the brave but life-saving decision to amputate her leg below the knee after doctors warned the disease could spread. By the time the disease was detected it had already spread to her lungs.

## Specialists Told Her Only Chance of Survival Was To Remove Her Right Leg Below The Knee

Without hesitation, Miss Walton agreed, putting her faith in her medical team, and has since been told she is free of the disease.

## Sophie's Story

Sophie first spotted a lump on her right foot after a night out with friends. Doctors thought she had broken her foot - something an X-ray later confirmed, but when the bone failed to heal properly, she was given an MRI scan which highlighted an abnormal growth.

*By the time her bone cancer was diagnosed it had already spread to her lungs.*

Just one week after her surgeon delivered the shocking news that she may need her leg amputation, the operation went ahead. She said: 'I was pain free when I woke up but I didn't feel relieved.'

## A Life-Changing Decision

Miss Walton made the brave decision to trial a new drug - a stronger form of chemotherapy, that could save her life but would leave her infertile. 'I had to give myself the best chance of survival,' she said.

## Overcoming Adversity

After finishing her trial drug treatment Miss Walton's health took another turn for the worst. She had a low liver function and her gall bladder had become inflamed. Doctors diagnosed her with veno-occlusive disease (VOD) - a condition in which some of the small veins in the liver are obstructed and is a known complication of high-dose chemotherapy.

## A Bright Future Ahead

But after a year of operations and treatment, in January 2013, Miss Walton was given the amazing news that the trial chemotherapy drug had worked, 90 per cent of the cancer in her lungs had disappeared. In February, she underwent an operation to remove the remaining cancer nobles from her lungs.

## Back To Normal

Two weeks later she was given the all clear. 'I had check-ups every two months to begin with but now it's every three,' she said. 'I also see a reproductive doctor as the chemo has left me completely infertile.'

## Support From Loved Ones

But with the support of her mother, Debra, 53, father, Steve, 59, step-dad, Richard, 52, and her two sisters, Rhyanna, 26 and Lara, 28, Miss Walton is now looking forward to the future.

## A New Chapter

She said: 'I've enrolled to do veterinary care at college this month which I can't wait to start. 'I have been on holiday a few times since losing my leg too. I know I'll be back wearing shorter dresses in no time.'

## Julie Harrington, Bone Cancer Research Trust Chief Executive Officer

Julie Harrington said: 'Sophie's fight back to fitness after her bone cancer diagnosis and amputation is a real triumph and inspiration, not only for her friend Mark, who will run in her honour, but also for others facing bone cancer.'","Sophie Walton was diagnosed with bone cancer in 2011 after discovering a lump on her foot months after breaking her leg .

After a year of treatment, including a rare complication that required six weeks in hospital, Sophie was given the all-clear in 2013.

The story highlights the bravery and resilience of someone diagnosed with bone cancer and the importance of research and awareness to improve outcomes for patients affected by this devastating disease."
c34b0d88c4c522da791c2304dd5ba641c3333df4,"**A Story of Ethnic Violence, Extreme Guilt, and Reconciliation**

Associated Press

She lost her baby daughter and her right hand to a manic killing spree. He wielded the machete that took both. Yet today, despite coming from opposite sides of an unspeakable shared past, Alice Mukarurinda and Emmanuel Ndayisaba are friends.

She is the treasurer and he the vice president of a group that builds simple brick houses for genocide survivors. They live near each other and shop at the same market. Their story of ethnic violence, extreme guilt, and, to some degree, reconciliation is the story of Rwanda today, 20 years after its Hutu majority killed more than 1 million Tutsis and moderate Hutus.

The Rwandan government is still accused of attempting to cover up the genocide, with many Hutus denying that it ever occurred. Alice worries that some genocide planners were never caught, and that messages denying the genocide still filter into the country from Hutus living abroad. She believes remembrance is important to ensure that another genocide never happens.

For Emmanuel, the anniversary periods bring back the nightmares. He looks like a man serving penance, who does not want to talk but feels he must. 'I've been asking myself why I acted like a fool, listening to such words, that this person is bad and that person is bad,' Emmanuel says. 'The same people that encouraged the genocide are the ones saying there was no genocide.'

He, too, worries that the embers of the genocide still smolder. 'The problem is still there,' Emmanuel says. 'There are Hutus who hate me for telling the truth. There are those up until now who participated in the genocide who deny they took part.'

**A Story of Forgiveness**

In this March 2014 photo, Rwandans are seen reflected in the windows of an office building going about their daily business.

Although Rwanda has made significant progress since the genocide, ethnic tensions remain. 'We had attended workshops and trainings and our hearts were kind of free, and I found it easy to forgive,' says Josephine Munyeli, director of peace and reconciliation programs in Rwanda for World Vision.

A survivor of the genocide herself, Munyeli says more killers and victims would like to reconcile but many don't know who they attacked or were attacked by. 'Forgiveness is possible. It's common here,' she says. 'Guilt is heavy. When one realizes how heavy it is the first thing they do to recuperate themselves is apologize.'

**A Story of Survival**

She was bloodied, scarred, and missing a hand, yes, but not dead. Alice fell unconscious, she says, and was found three days later by other survivors.

It was only then that she realized she no longer had a right hand. In the months after the genocide, guilt gnawed away at Emmanuel. He saw his victims during nightmares. In 1996, he turned himself in and confessed. His prison term lasted from 1997 until 2003, when Kagame pardoned Hutus who admitted their guilt.

After he was freed, he began asking family members of his victims for forgiveness. He joined a group of genocide killers and survivors called Ukurrkuganze, who still meet weekly. It was there that he saw Alice, the woman he thought he had killed. At first he avoided her. Eventually he kneeled before her and asked for forgiveness.

After two weeks of thought and long discussions with her husband, she said yes. 'We had attended workshops and trainings and our hearts were kind of free, and I found it easy to forgive,' says Alice. 'The Bible says you should forgive and you will also be forgiven.'","Tutsi Alice Mukarurinda's hand was amputated and her baby was killed by Emmanuel Ndayisaba, a Hutu, in 1994 .
On Monday Rwanda marks the 20th anniversary of the beginning of 100 days of bloody mayhem .
Hutus resented Tutsis for their greater wealth and what they saw as oppressive rule .
Emmanuel turned himself in and confessed for his crimes in 1996 .
Prison term lasted from 1997 until 2003, when Hutus who admitted their guilt were pardoned .
Emmanuel and Alice live near each other and shop at the same market .
Emmanuel kneeled before Alice and asked for forgiveness -- and after two weeks of thought she said yes .","In Rwanda, two decades after the 1994 genocide that killed over 1 million Tutsis and moderate Hutus, former enemies Alice Mukarurinda and Emmanuel Ndayisaba have formed an unlikely friendship. In 1994, Emmanuel, then 23, was ordered to kill a family of Tutsis by local Hutu leaders and carried out the massacre, also killing a doctor and two women with their child. Alice survived but lost her baby daughter and right hand to Emmanuel's machete. After serving in prison for six years, Emmanuel began seeking forgiveness from his victims' families, including Alice, whom he had thought killed. The two now work together on a project to help genocide survivors and perpetrators reconcile, with many Rwandans demonstrating remarkable capacity for forgiveness despite the trauma of their past."

### A Woman Set to Give Birth from a Transplanted Womb

#### A Breakthrough in Medicine

A woman is set to become the first in the world to give birth from a transplanted womb after doctors successfully implanted an embryo into her body. This remarkable achievement marks a significant milestone in the field of medicine, offering new hope to thousands of childless women across Europe and at least 15,000 in the UK.

#### A Woman Born Without a Womb

The unnamed woman was born without a womb, suffering from MRKH syndrome, a congenital disorder that prevents the development of the womb. However, she still has intact ovaries that produce eggs, which can be fertilized outside her body and implanted into her transplanted womb.

#### A Transplant Operation Ahead of Its Time

The woman was one of nine to undergo a womb transplant in Sweden between September 2012 and April last year. The surgery involved transferring an embryo grown from the woman's own egg into her transplanted womb, which was donated by her mother. This innovative procedure means that any child she has through IVF would be genetically her own.

#### A New Era for Childless Women

This groundbreaking achievement opens up new possibilities for childless women who were previously unable to bear children due to uterine infertility. The Swedish team's success has sparked hope for thousands of women across Europe and beyond, offering a chance for them to fulfill their deep-seated yearning to have a baby.

#### A Procedure Marked by Controversy

While the breakthrough is celebrated, it is essential to acknowledge that the method involves taking wombs from living donors. This has sparked controversy among some surgeons who believe that putting a living donor through such a major operation is not justifiable unless life-saving. Nevertheless, the Swedish team favors this approach due to the better condition and immunological match of the organs.

#### A New Option for British Women

The development has also prompted Womb Transplant UK to consider using wombs from dead donors. The charity is ready to give five British women wombs from deceased donors, subject to receiving ethical clearance and raising the necessary funds.

#### An Uncertain Future

While the Swedish team is optimistic about the success of this procedure, it's essential to acknowledge that there are still uncertainties surrounding its viability. Experts caution that the biggest worry is how well a transplanted womb will cope with the strains of pregnancy. The operation will only be considered a success on the birth of a healthy baby.

#### A Historic Achievement in the Making

As the world watches this historic achievement unfold, one thing is certain: it marks a significant step forward for medicine and offers new hope to childless women across the globe. Will this procedure prove to be a game-changer, or will it remain confined to research and limited experimentation? Only time will tell.","Woman suffers from MRKH syndrome - a congenital disorder which prevents the womb from developing, but doesn't impact the ovaries .
She was one of nine women to undergo a womb transplant in Sweden .
Doctors have transferred an embryo grown from her own egg to her womb .
She will have to wait to see if the embryo embeds in the uterine wall to find out whether she is in fact pregnant .

This means any child she has through IVF would be genetically her own. If successful, this would be a groundbreaking achievement, providing hope to thousands of childless women across Europe and beyond. The procedure is not without controversy, however, as it involves taking wombs from living donors. A successful birth would prove that womb transplants are a viable option for women with uterine infertility, but critics argue the risks are too great and some women should accept they will never bear children."

The girlfriend of a Texas man who was aboard the missing Malaysian Airlines plane has revealed how she anxiously waited at their home in China for the flight that never arrived.

**Sarah Bajc**, who is also an American expat, said the desperate wait for information about her long-term boyfriend **Philip Wood** was 'one of the most painful things I have ever had to go through'.

She had sent a car to Beijing Airport to collect Wood, who worked in Beijing for IBM, as he returned from a trip visiting family in Texas.

As she waited, she tracked his journey on the airline's website.

> ""The online site tracker said it was just delayed; that it took off on time but that it hadn't landed.""

Bajc, 48, told CBS News.

Waiting for news: Sarah Bajc, left, was at home in Beijing when she learned that the plane flying her boyfriend Philip Wood, right, back to her was missing.

She can now do nothing but wait for information.

> ""Then I looked at the online news, and there was the news that the plane was missing.""

The lack of consistency of information has been incredibly frustrating and confusing.'

She persevered and found a press release saying the airport had lost contact with the plane and that loved ones should call a number, which she tried 'on and off for several hours'.

> ""Finally they contacted me since I was listed as next of kin, and they were able to tell me nothing other than the fact that they lost contact.""

I queried them about the various news reports that I'd seen online, first there was a reported landing, then there was a reported wreckage, then the oil spill and the passports, and they literally cannot confirm any of it.'

But Bajc, who was hoping to move to Kuala Lumpur with Wood, 50, in the near future as he relocated for a new assignment with IBM, said she was glad that they did not respond to these speculations.

Family: Wood is pictured with his two sons, **Chris** and **Nick**, who said 'odds are' they won't see him again.

Sadness: The men said they accepted they might never see Wood again but that they would always hold hope.

Heartbroken: Wood's father broke down as he recounted his son's love of travel and 'big heart'

> ""The rest of the news media and social media that keep pushing out this false information are really making this an awful roller coaster for those involved.""

But Bajc added that knowing nothing about the flight gave her hope.

> ""I'm personally not willing to give up hope that there's a chance we'll find survivors, that we'll find the plane.""

There just has to be a chance.'

Wood was one of three Americans who were aboard the Boeing 777 when it lost contact with air traffic control.

The family has been contacted by the U.S. Department of State and the embassy in Malaysia.

A second brother, **Tom Wood**, said the events have left 'a real hole in our family,' but he said they aren't giving up hope.

> ""You never know.'

I'm not gonna close that door until we need to close it completely.'""

So far, no explanation as to what happened to the plane is available.

There was no distress signal before the plane vanished from the radar.

The family said they are watching CNN, BBC and other news stations, waiting for small pieces of information on anything about the missing plane.

BBC chairman Lord Patten faced renewed calls to resign yesterday after he accused a parliamentary committee of ‘shabby’ treatment when it criticised ex-director-general George Entwistle’s bumper payoff.

## The Tory peer clashed with Labour MP Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, over a report which attacked the ‘cavalier’ use of public money to give Mr Entwistle a ‘reward for failure’ after a mere 54 days in the job. 

Lord Patten accused MPs of ‘taking no notice’ of 12 pages of legal advice the BBC Trust had supplied – which he said showed it would have faced a bigger payout had they not agreed the deal.

## Defence: 
BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten has maintained that the package was a good deal for taxpayers

In a scattergun approach, he attacked MPs, the NHS and the Press, and said his hands were tied by the corporation’s lawyers. He suggested some newspapers, naming the Daily Mail and Daily Telegraph, were overly critical of the payout although he seemed finally to accept that Mr Entwistle was the ‘wrong man’.

## On Mr Entwistle’s appointment to the job of Director General, he added: 
‘With the benefit of hindsight, we chose the wrong one. But we chose him from a very distinguished field. 'It was the unanimous choice of the whole of the BBC Trust.’ 

He defended the BBC’s approach to the Jimmy Savile scandal – saying it had acted more swiftly than the National Health Service in response to the revelations about the TV presenter’s sordid past.

## The NHS, which has received allegations from former patients at three trusts, has still to start formal inquiries into what went wrong. 

Miss Hodge said the BBC chairman should accept there might be ‘different views’ about his decision to rush through a generous deal with Mr Entwistle, adding: ‘He may not be right.’ 

She pointed out that there had been a **culture of generous settlements** to former executives, including former chief operating officer Caroline Thomson who received £670,000 earlier this year after she was passed over for the director general’s job. 

‘They just don’t get it,’ she said.

## Scandal: 
George Entwistle (left) was paid £450,000 to leave the BBC after 54 days in the job - which Public Accounts Committee chairman Margaret Hodge (right) says was an unacceptable amount

Senior Labour backbencher Barry Sheerman said he was shocked by Lord Patten’s comments, saying the remarks ‘merits his resignation’.

Last month Mr Entwistle was given a full year’s salary – £450,000 – double what he was entitled to ensure a speedy resignation amid the crisis caused by Newsnight’s dropped Savile investigation and the botched report which wrongfully linked Lord McAlpine to the abuse of children.

## His deal also provided 
*   a year’s private healthcare
*   fees for lawyers
*   even £10,000 to pay for Press advice

The PAC said the deal was ‘out of line both with public expectations and what is considered acceptable elsewhere in the public sector’.

MPs also criticised ‘excessive’ severance payments to ten other senior managers, including Miss Thomson.

## On Radio 4’s Today programme, the BBC chairman said: 
‘You are not supposed to criticise the Public Accounts Committee ... in politics it is sort of the equivalent of swearing in church. The Public Accounts Committee - “I do think the treatment we have had is shabby”.’

Lord Patten said the BBC has taken legal advice on whether it can recoup some of the £450,000 payoff given to Mr Entwistle, but was not hopeful.

*One of the Muslim leaders called to a meeting with Australian Federal Police as the Sydney siege unfolded, is in no doubt that gunman Man Haron Monis would have surrendered, if he had been allowed to talk with him.*

# The Story Behind

Keysar Trad, one of the Muslim leaders called to a meeting with Australian Federal Police as the Sydney siege unfolded, is in no doubt that gunman Man Haron Monis would have surrendered, if he had been allowed to talk with him.

**The Meeting**

""They could have let someone like me talk with him, someone who had met him before, I knew him and I would have got him to surrender, I am fairly confident,"" Mr Trad said. He said neither his offer nor that of other community leaders made during the day, including that of Australia's most senior Muslim cleric the Grand Mufti, was accepted.

**The Offer**

Further, he added, they were not sought out for any advice as it dragged on. ""I was saying it all day, let us help.""

**Background**

Islamic Friendship Association founder Keysar Trad is pictured on his way to a meeting with government officials last year to discuss the counter-terrorism laws. He says police should have involved Muslim leaders in negotiations with Sydney siege gunman Man Haron Monis.

**Previous Incidents**

The same year in which Sydney Siege gunman Man Monis (left) was dropped from the national watch lists, it’s been revealed he was also reported to AFP for repeatedly threatening an Islamic school principal. Islamic Friendship Association founder Keysar Trad said police should have let him talk to the hostage-taker during the Martin Place Lindt cafe stand-off last month.

**The Meeting with Police**

It's believed among those represented at the Monday morning (December 15) briefing with the Australian Federal Police, which was in relation to anti-terror raids and not the early stages of the siege, were representatives of the Islamic Friendship Association, Islamic Council of New South Wales, the United Muslim Women's Association, Lebanese Muslim Association, the Muslim Village and a former AFP official of Muslim background.

**The Tense Moments**

Word of the drama in Sydney's CBD had begun to filter through to the 10am gathering at a Bankstown hotel in the city's south-west and those involved in the meeting say they made it known they wanted to be involved, if required. The official briefing was quickly wound up but Mr Trad, who is the founder of the Islamic Friendship Association, revealed that there were tense scenes even as the meeting came to an end.

**The Last Moments**

He said some at the gathering disagreed over the potential level of involvement from the Muslim community, saying 'we had an argument'. Vision inside the Lindt cafe of long gunman Man Haron Monis during the 17-hour stand-off. He took 18 hostages.

**The Aftermath**

More than 100,000 bouquets were placed at the shrine in Martin Place in the days after the siege. The flowers placed in memory of the Lindt cafe siege hostages will feature as part of a permanent memorial, after having been mulched.

**The Reflections**

""It's been revealed the Grand Mufti of Australia, Dr Ibrahim Abu Mohammad, was ready to become involved but was not sought for advice nor involved at an official level, with senior police admitting at the time that even 11 hours into the stand-off there had been limited, if any, contact directly with the gunman.

**The Different Views**

While others suggest police erred in not taking advice from Muslim community leaders, Ahmed Kilani of the Muslim Village sees it differently saying ""I can't really find any fault in what they have done. They were being very, very careful not to risk people's lives"".","Muslim leader insist Man Haron Monis 'would have surrendered'
The founder of Islamic Friendship Association says he could have stopped the bloodshed, if police had taken up the Muslim community's offer to help .
Prominent members of Australia's Muslim community were locked in counter-terror raid briefings in Sydney's south-west when the siege began .
AFP officers were told 'all our resources are available' but no member of the Muslim community was consulted during the 17 hour stand-off .
There was also a tense debate at the morning meeting between Islamic representatives as to whether they should get involved .
The meeting with the AFP at Bankstown began at 10am and was shut down before 11 as the siege situation at Martin Place heightened .","Keysar Trad, a Muslim leader, claims that gunman Man Haron Monis would have surrendered if allowed to talk with him during the Sydney siege. Trad and other community leaders offered to help negotiate with Monis, but their offers were not accepted by police. Trad believes that allowing someone he knew, like himself, to speak with Monis could have prevented bloodshed. He also expressed frustration that officials were selective in who was told vital information about Monis' identity, and that he was not included despite his offer to sign a waiver accepting responsibility for his actions if harmed by the gunman. Trad's comments come as authorities continue to investigate the siege and its aftermath."

### By Lizzie Parry
#### PUBLISHED: 07:37 EST, 6 February 2014 | UPDATED: 07:38 EST, 6 February 2014

An Orthodox Jewish woman has finally won her freedom after a two-year battle for religious divorce from her husband. Gital Dodelson has been granted a 'get' by her ex-husband Avrohom Meir Weiss, after the pair legally divorced in 2012.

#### A Mother's Fight for Freedom

Gital Dodelson, 25, divorced her husband Avrohom Meir Weiss in 2012. After a four-year battle to be granted a 'get' -  the document that must be signed by a husband for a divorce to be recognized by Jewish law, she has finally won her freedom.

#### The Struggle is Real

The law student, who lives in Lakewood, New Jersey, told the New York Post she divorced Mr Weiss in 2012, but spent years trying to get him to grant her the 'get' - a document that must be signed by a husband for a divorce to be recognised by Jewish law. Without the document, she was seen as an **agunah** - a chained woman - in the eyes of the Orthodox community, who considered her still married to Mr Weiss.

#### A Life in Limbo

The mother-of-one from Lakewood, New Jersey, explained that her husband - whom she said has always been a controlling man - comes from a respected rabbinic family, making it all the more difficult to loosen herself from his power. After numerous attempts to reach an agreement, all met with the same defiance, Ms Dodelson has decided to make her story public in an effort to move on with her life.

#### A Warning Sign

She says she saw signs that Mr Weiss would be a difficult husband just three days into their marriage in 2009, when they spent their first Shabbat together in complete silence. Explaining that the observance is typically a female tradition, she says he lost his temper when she was telling him how it was done in her family.

#### The Red Flags

'When my way contradicted his way, he criticized me and turned angry,' she wrote. Her husband then told her: 'You have no choice. It's not my way' - an attitude he was to exhibit consistently over the following four years. The couple separated within a year of getting married, prompting a bitter battle between their Orthodox families, with Weiss reportedly demanding upwards of $350,000 to settle the matter.

#### A Desperate Plea

Miss Dodelson told the Post, in November: 'On my last mission to ask for a get, a month ago, Avrohom said, ""I can’t give you a get — how else would I control you?"" 'I think that’s the key to it all. He insists the marriage isn’t over until he says it’s over.'

#### A Global Outcry

A Facebook group **Free Gital: Tell Avrohom Meir Weiss to Give His Wife a Get** was set up, attracting more than 14,000 supporters across the world.

#### New Beginnings

Miss Dodelson's publicist, Shira Dicker, said she could not say why Weiss had changed his mind. The Weiss family, when approached for comment, declined. Miss Dicker said Miss Dodelson and her family have vowed to set up a not-for-profit organisation to help other women facing similar problems win their freedom.

#### A New Path

Refusing to grant a get is viewed in Jewish law as domestic abuse, but Mr Weiss had said he would sign only if she rearranged the custody arrangement and gave him $350,000. She added: 'The family isn't just skipping into the sunset. There's a real sense of responsibility here.'

#### A Pattern of Control

Mr Weiss not only took control when it came to religious observances, but also when it came to the couple's finances, despite his wife being the sole breadwinner. When she suggested couples therapy, he refused, and every attempt to communicate was met with silence and hostility.

#### A Mother's Resolve

It was when she became pregnant that she decided to take a stand against her overbearing other half. 'I thought: ""How can I bring a child into this world with a virtual stranger? Someone I'm so disconnected from?""' she said.

#### A New Chapter

Mr Weiss ultimately granted her a divorce - after first attempting to file for sole custody of their son Aryeh. He repeatedly refused to give her a get, something which in Jewish law is viewed as domestic abuse. As a man he was free to date other women, while his ex-wife was stuck in limbo in a community where her moving on would have been classed as adultery.","Gital Dodelson was legally divorced from Avrohom Meir Weiss in 2012 .
But for years he refused to give her a get - the document that must be signed by a husband for a divorce to be recognised by Jewish law .
Without a get, she was still seen as married in her community, and would be ostracised if she were to move on romantically .
Three months after speaking publicly about her struggle the 25-year-old has finally received the document allowing her to move on .
She has vowed to set up a not-for-profit organisation to help other women facing similar problems .","Gital Dodelson, a 25-year-old Orthodox Jewish woman, has finally gained freedom from her controlling husband Avrohom Meir Weiss after a two-year battle for religious divorce. Despite divorcing him in 2012, she was unable to obtain a ""get"" - a document required by Jewish law for a divorce to be recognized - due to Weiss's refusal to grant it. The couple's marriage had been marked by control and abuse, with Weiss exerting power over Dodelson through manipulation of Jewish law. A social media campaign, Free Gital, attracted 14,000 supporters worldwide, putting pressure on Weiss to grant the divorce. After years of resistance, Weiss finally signed the get, allowing Dodelson to move on with her life."

A 36 year old woman who had sex with a 12-year-old boy has been jailed for 10 years.

Joy Leaann McCall, from Ocala, Florida, had sex three times with the young boy who was the same age as her own children. She was given 10 years in prison for each charge of lewd or lascivious battery on a child between 12 and 15 but told the sentence would run concurrently.

**Sentenced: Joy McCall**

McCall pleaded guilty to the second-degree felony charges and was given a 134-day credit for time already spent in jail. The court heard that the 12-year-old, who has not been named, told police that he received Facebook messages from the woman. He said the messages 'continued to get more heated' and he later received photos of her posing in underwear.

**The Affair Unfolds**

McCall arranged to meet the boy at a local shopping mall where she picked him up and ended up having sex in the back seat of her car. The boy claimed he contacted her again five days later. She collected him and drove him to some woods, where they had sex again.

**A Third Encounter**

He claimed they met for a third time on February 16th and had sex in the same wooded area. McCall, a shop worker, later admitted to police she had sex with the boy.

**The Affair is Exposed**

The affair leaked out after the young boy confided in a friend who told the victim's mother, according to the Ocala Star Banner. Police were called after the boy's mom read some of the text messages sent by McCall to her son.

""She was able to see through the different text messaging that had occurred between McCall and the juvenile. And determine the dates that the incidents had occurred,"" Sergeant Angy Scroble told WCJB back in February.","Joy Leaann McCall, 36, had sex three times with the 12-year-old boy who was the same age as her own children .

## Almost 9,500 People Had Knee Replacement Surgery Last Year Due to Obesity

The nation's knees are crumbling under the strain of the obesity crisis, MailOnline can reveal. Almost 9,500 people classed as obese, including two teenagers, underwent knee replacement surgery last year, at a cost of more than £50 million.

## The Numbers Have Surged by 150 Percent in Just Four Years

The numbers have surged by 150 percent in just four years, and raise fresh concerns about the extraordinary cost to the NHS of dealing with expanding waistlines. Almost 9,500 people had knee replacement surgery last year because their joints could not cope with their weight, at a cost of more than £50 million to the NHS.

## Obesity Costs the NHS £5.1 Billion Each Year

Obesity costs the NHS £5.1 billion each year with 40,000 people dying as a result of being overweight or obese. Now it can be revealed that one in 10 patients given new knees is obese, up from one in 20 just four years ago.

## The Problem Will Only Get Worse Unless Urgent Action Is Taken

Tory MP Sarah Wollaston, chairman of the health select committee, warned the problem would only get worse unless urgent action was taken to prevent obesity causing increased disabilities. Data compiled for MailOnline shows how the number of knee operations for obese patients has soared from 3,787 in 2009-10 to 9,438 in 2012-13.

## A Knee Replacement Costs Around £5,500

A knee replacement costs around £5,500, meaning the bill for last year alone could have topped £52 million. The NHS says a replacement knee will last for around 15 to 20 years if it is ""not put under too much strain,"" raising the prospect of the same people undergoing repeated surgery throughout their lives.

## Women Are Almost Twice as Likely as Men to Need Treatment

Of the 9,438 operations last year, almost 6,000 were for female patients. Women are almost twice as likely as men to need treatment. Tam Fry, from the National Obesity Forum, said: ""These figures will continue to rise.""

## The Human Body Has Evolved for Perfection

The human body has evolved for perfection and the knees and the legs and arms and all the bones fit together beautifully. What we have done over the last 50 years to an incredible degree is upset the balance of evolution.

## A Knee Replacement Is Classed as ""Major Surgery"" by the NHS

A knee replacement is classed as ""major surgery"" by the NHS and is only offered after other treatments, such as physiotherapy or steroid injections have failed to help. Last year one in 10 patients given new knees was obese, up from one in 20 just four years ago.

## The Department of Health Warned Obesity Affects All Age Groups

The Department of Health warned obesity affects all age groups and ""there is no magic bullet to solve the problem"". A spokesman said: ""It is going to take continued effort from all of us; Government, local communities, industry and individuals to reverse this trend.""

## Free Weight-Loss Surgery Could Be Offered to Nearly a Million Diabetes Patients

This month it was announced free weight-loss surgery could be offered to nearly a million diabetes patients. The health watchdog NICE called for more obese people with the condition to be considered for a gastric band or bypass. At a stroke, the ruling doubled to 1.8 million the numbers qualifying for taxpayer-funded surgery.

## Official Guidance Suggests Most Knee Operations Are Offered for Arthritis

Official guidance suggests that most knee operations are offered for arthritis, with the over-65s most likely need treatment. However, a quarter of those classed as obese who had knee operations were under 60. There has been a three-fold increase in knee replacements among the under-40s.

## In the Last Year Alone Nine People in Their Twenties and Seventy Thirty-Somethings Had Knee Operations

In the last year alone nine people in their twenties and seventy thirty-somethings had knee operations due to obesity. The NHS says a replacement knee will last for around 15 to 20 years if it is ""not put under too much strain,"" raising the prospect of the same people undergoing repeated surgery throughout their lives.

## Everyone Over the Age of 40 Can Have a Free NHS Health Check

Everyone over the age of 40 can have a free NHS health check to spot the warning signs of long-term illness- more people are taking them up than ever before. And for the first time we have given local authorities the power and over £5 billion in funding to tackle public health issues in their areas.","EXCLUSIVE: Almost 9,500 people classed as obese given  knee replacements .

The surgeon's transportation to the U.S. brings up questions as to what the Obama administration's policy is on paying for non-U.S. citizens' chartered flights back to America for treatment.

## The Situation in Sierra Leone

The situation in Sierra Leone is dire, with many people affected by Ebola and struggling to receive medical attention.

## The Role of Dr. Salia

Dr. Martin Salia will be flown from Sierra Leone to the United States where he will undergo treatment at the University of Nebraska Medical Center.

## Background about MEDEVAC Capabilities

The U.S. Department of State has denied allegations that they are trying to bring non-U.S. citizens to the country for Ebola treatment, stating that their primary goal is to evacuate their own citizens from West Africa using specially-equipped planes.

## Quotes from Experts and Officials

""Just the simple act of transporting somebody from West Africa to the United States, the person's got to be medically stable enough as well,"" said Dr. Sanjay Gupta, a CNN Medical Correspondent.

""There are absolutely no plans to MEDEVAC non-Americans who become ill from West Africa to the United States,"" stated an official at the U.S. Department of State.

## Background about Ebola Outbreak

The Ebola outbreak in West Africa has resulted in over 5,000 deaths and thousands more infected with the virus.

## The Current Situation in the U.S.

There are currently no Ebola patients being treated in the United States after Dr. Craig Spencer, a doctor with Doctors Without Borders, was released from Bellevue Hospital on Tuesday after testing negative for Ebola.

## Quotes from Politicians

""This is simply a matter of common sense that if you are concerned about this problem spreading … we certainly shouldn't be bringing in the patients,"" said Bob Goodlatte, House Judiciary Committee Chairman.

""We have discussed allowing other countries to use our MEDEVAC capabilities to evacuate their own citizens to their home countries or third-countries, subject to reimbursement and availability. But we are not contemplating bringing them back to the U.S. for treatment,"" stated an official at the U.S. Department of State.

## The Situation with Ebola Patients in the United States

Nurses Nina Pham and Amber Vinson contracted Ebola after treating a patient who had traveled from Liberia, but both nurses were subsequently cured after receiving treatment.

**PUBLISHED: 09:08 EST, 10 December 2013 | UPDATED: 16:51 EST, 10 December 2013**

Supermodel Elle Macpherson is accused of helping her billionaire husband conceal that he was flying a helicopter that crashed last year and took the life of his best friend.

**Ms Macpherson urged widow Daria Valdez to take the payout after husband Jeffrey Soffer, who also owns Miami's Fontainebleau Hotel, piloted the chopper into the ground Nov 22, 2012 in the Bahamas, the lawsuit says.**

Mr Soffer was at the helm despite not being licensed to fly. A licensed pilot was on board the aircraft but not at the controls, the suit alleges.

**The $100million wrongful death suit was filed Monday in Miami.**

As if nothing happened: Elle Macpherson and husband Jeff Soffer attend Perez Art Museum last week in Miami .

A copy of the lawsuit reviewed by MailOnline claims that Mr Soffer was at the controls when the helicopter crashed on Great Cauna Cay last year, taking the life of tax lawyer Lance Valdez.

‘Contrary to published newspaper reports, at the time of the helicopter crash, the helicopter was being piloted by Jeffrey Soffer,’ the suit claims. ‘Soffer was not licensed to fly,’ the suit continues. ‘[Nor was he a] sufficiently experienced helicopter pilot.’

The suit also accuses supermodel Elle Macpherson of taking part in the conspiracy by personally calling close friends for the purpose of having them convince the devastated widow to take the money.

'The Soffer induced...Elle Macpherson...to call Charles Holzer, another close friend of both Lance and Daria, and told him that Soffer was annoyed about Daria’s delay in signing the release, telling Holzer that ‘Soffer doesn’t have to do this you know,' the suit alleges.

Taking the millions in hush money meant signing a release relieving Mr Soffer of all liability stemming from the crash, according to the suit.

Shattered: Dasha and Lance Valdez in a photo from 2008, the picture of happiness .

'They knew Daria was beset with grief…at the time that they inappropriately pressured her to sign a release they knew was based upon false information,' the suit said. 'They took undue and improper advantage of her and the situation and circumstances surrounding the helicopter crash,' it continued.

Pilot David Pearce also signed a lawsuit guaranteeing him a six-figure salary with Mr Soffer's company in exchange for swearing he was piloting the helicopter at the time it crashed, according to the suit.

Mr Valdez, 48 and a father of three, was joined on the flight by a handful of other people but was the only one who did not survive the accident, according to the suit.

Daria Valdez, now a widow, claims in the suit she was handed $2million in insurance hush money to keep quiet about Mr Soffer piloting the chopper into the ground.

According to the bombshell lawsuit, co-defendants Daniel and Paula Riordan, as well as Alex Krys, were also on board the ill-fated flight and conspired with Mr Soffer and the pilot to conceal who was actually flying the chopper when her husband died.

‘The defendants] conspired and otherwise agreed to conceal… [that Mr Soffer] was flying the helicopter at the time of the crash,’ the suit says. ‘The purpose of this concealment and deception was, in turn, to induce [Mr Valdez’s widow] to accept $2million in insurance proceeds from insurance maintained on the helicopter… and to avoid liability for damages resulting from the wrongful death of Mr. Valdez.’

**He did not contact Mr Valdez’s widow until four days later, and also skipped his pal’s funeral.**

'Jeff Soffer is very sympathetic to Dasha and the children for their grave loss [and] denies all the allegations of wrongdoing,' his lawyer told the New York Post in a statement.

*   Passengers on board a research ship that has been trapped in Antarctic ice since Christmas Eve are expected to be rescued by helicopter tomorrow.
*   Three icebreakers failed to reach the paralysed vessel, but a helicopter on board a Chinese icebreaker, the Snow Dragon, aims to collect the 52 passengers trapped on the Russian ship MV Akademik Shokalskiy.
*   Ironically, the Akademik had gone in search of evidence of the world’s melting ice caps but instead the team of climate scientists had to abandon their mission because the ice is thicker than usual at this time of year.

**Rescue Operation**

The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) said the rescue would be a complex operation. Passengers on board Russian ship MV Akademik Shokalskiy that has been trapped in Antarctic ice since Christmas Eve are expected to be rescued by helicopter tomorrow.

*   A helicopter on board a Chinese icebreaker, the Snow Dragon, aims to collect the 52 passengers.
*   The 22 members of crew will remain on the stricken vessel.
*   This image, taken by passenger Andrew Peacock, shows the ship still stuck in the ice off East Antarctica, as it waits to be rescued.

**Background and Details**

The expedition, which set off from New Zealand on November 28, is being led by Chris Turney, a climate scientist, who was hoping to reach the base camp of Douglas Mawson, one of the most famous Antarctic explorers, and repeat observations done by him in 1912 to see what impact climate change had made.

*   Trapped: 74 people, including scientists, tourists, and a Guardian reporter, are stuck in thick ice sheets.
*   Crew members routinely check the hull of the ship, which gathers fresh layers of snow every night.
*   The looming helicopter rescue means the expedition will have to be cut short, Stone said.

**Current Situation**

Despite being stranded, those on board appear to be taking it all in stride. 'Surprisingly, all the passengers seem to be considering it the adventure of a lifetime,' Stone said.

*   Turney has also posted a photograph on Twitter apparently showing the Chinese vessel, a speck on the horizon beyond an expanse of ice.
*   ""Everyone well,"" Turney added.
*   He said trying to break through ice that was too thick would be 'like driving your car into a brick wall'.

**Update and Status**

The researchers on board have managed to get messages out saying they are well-stocked and continuing their research despite being trapped in five metres of ice sheets 1,500 miles south of Tasmanian capital Hobart.

*   Failed: This picture, tweeted by passenger Chris Turney, shows the top-of-the-range icebreaker, China's 'Snow Dragon' which also got stuck and was forced to retreat on Friday.
*   Russia's Academic Shokalskiy is recreating Mawson's 100-year-old Australasia expedition using new tools.
*   Blizzards could hamper the rescue mission, but the ship is well-stocked, and the scientists are continuing their research on the snow around them.
*   And he tweeted: 'Heavy ice. Beautiful; light wind. Only -1degC. All well. Merry Xmas everyone from AAE'.

**The Ship and the Expedition**

Academic Shokalskiy, an ice-strengthened ship built in 1982, was originally used for oceanographic research before being refurbished to be used as a passenger vessel in the Arctic and Antarctica.

*   Marooned. 1,500 nautical miles south of Hobart - the capital of the Australian state of Tasmania - the thick ice sheets built up during a bout of severe wind.
*   The Russian embassy in Australia has been in constant contact with the captain and said everyone on board was in good health and there was 'no threat to their lives or safety'.
*   The ship had been on a multi-day tour from New Zealand to visit several sites along the edge of Antarctica before getting trapped in sea ice.
*   On board are scientists from the University of New South Wales, a journalist from The Guardian, and dozens of tourists who have paid to be part of the recreation of Mawson’s expedition.","MV Akademik Schokalskiy is stuck in thick ice sheet .

782fdb4e370e08d58dcd681f5f0041aa58628239,"**A Labor MP has demanded Prime Minister Tony Abbott provides evidence that he is no longer a British citizen.**

Terri Butler, MP for Griffith in Queensland, questioned the PM over whether he is still a dual citizen after being contacted 'on numerous occasions on social media' by blogger Tony Magrathea, from the Sunshine Coast.

**Mr Abbott was born in London, England, in 1957 to an Australian mother and English father and came to Australia in 1960 as an assisted migrant.**

He applied for Australian citizenship in 1981, becoming a dual citizen of Australia and Britain, and then reportedly – on an undisclosed date – renounced his British citizenship.

**If Mr Abbott is still a British citizen he would not be eligible to be Prime Minister.**

Labor MP Terri Butler has written a letter to Prime Minister Tony Abbott asking him about his citizenship.

The PM was born in London, England, in 1957 to an Australian mother and English father.

Mr Magrathea is said to have emailed politicians across the country asking them if they were purposely staying quiet about the PM allegedly being a dual citizen, Independent Australia reports.

**The blogger previously reportedly submitted a Freedom of Information request to the Prime Minister's office and the British Home Office seeking a copy of Mr Abbott’s RN form.**

The form is used by British subjects to renounce their citizenship.

As part of the Australian constitution, people who hold dual citizenship are not permitted to stand for election to Federal Parliament.

In his email to MPs, Mr Magrathea wrote:

‘The Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet declared in an FOI request, 2014-159, in October last year, that Mr Abbott is still a dual citizen of Britain and Australia.’

Ms Butler is thought to be the only MP who responded to Mr Magrathea’s email.

She promised to write to Mr Abbott and ask him to provide the requested RN form as evidence.

**Ms Butler sent the letter on Friday and asked him to provide Mr Magarathea 'with a copy of the declaration of renunciation' that he received when he renounced his British citizenship.**

In her letter to the Mr Abbott on Friday, Ms Butler wrote:

‘I have received an email from a Mr Tony Magarthea who asserts that you have yet to renounce your British citizenship, I enclose my response to Mr Magrathea.

‘I make no claim that you are ineligible to sit in the House of Representatives, that your election was void, or that you have failed to renounce your British citizenship. I have seen no evidence that would satisfy me of any such claim(s).

‘However, I also have no desire to continue to receive, and respond to, communications questioning your eligibility under section 44(i) of the Constitution.

‘For that reason, I believe it would assist if you would provide Mr Magrathea with a copy of the declaration of renunciation that you received after renouncing your citizenship. Alternatively, it would assist if you would advise the date of your renunciation. ‘Thank you, in advance, for considering this letter.’

However, a spokesperson for Ms Butler told Daily Mail Australia the MP believes ‘it’s a non-issue’.

He confirmed Ms Butler has not received a response yet, but highlighted the letter was ‘only posted on Friday.’

‘Terri’s got no view on Tony’s citizenship,’ the spokesperson said.

‘He’d [Tony Magrathea] contacted her on numerous occasions on social media and she was just making sure the guy got some sort of reply,’ he explained.

‘Terri believes the battleground with the LNP is on policy and ideology not on citizenship, she’d be highly surprised if he wasn’t a citizen in the 2013 election… she won’t be taking any further action. ‘She was just making sure this guy got a reply from a parliamentary representative, she doesn’t think it is an issue or ever was an issue.

**Mr Abbott (centre) applied for Australian citizenship in 1981, becoming a dual citizen of Australia and Britain, and studied at Oxford University in England.**

The PM's office previously denied that Mr Abbott (right, next to British Prime Minister David Cameron) is still a dual citizen.

‘She stated clearly in her letter we should be focusing on policy and not citizenship issues.’

Her request was denied by Robert McMahon, the Assistant Secretary of the Parliamentary and Government Branch, because 'no documents relevant to the request are in the possession of the Department'.

The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet said 'no relevant documents were found' when they searched for them.

Also in September, NineMsn were told by the Prime Minister's Office and the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet that Mr Abbott has renounced his British Citizenship.

‘The Prime Minister is an Australian citizen and does not hold citizenship of any other country,’ the Department reportedly said.","MP Terri Butler wrote to the Prime Minister on Friday .

*By Ashley Collman*

PUBLISHED: 09:40 EST, 13 September 2013 | UPDATED: 14:43 EST, 13 September 2013

When it comes to bikini competition day, the harshest judges are the beauty queens themselves. Sources told the New York Post that Miss New York Nina Davuluri called current Miss America Mallory Hagan 'fat as [expletive]'.

After winning the Miss New York competition on July 16, Ms Davuluri invited friends back to her hotel room to celebrate, and that's when another competitor overheard her slinging insults at Ms Hagan.

**Harsh: Sources tell the New York Post that the current Miss New York called Miss America Mallory Hagan 'fat as [expletive]'.**

Above, Ms Hagan competing in the Miss America pageant last January

Frenemies: Mallory Hagan, left, and Nina Davuluri, right, competed with each other in the Miss New York competition the year that Ms Hagan won, and Ms Davuluri was second runner-up

Catty: A fellow beauty queen says she overheard Miss New York Nina Davuluri, right, calling Miss America Mallory Hagan, left, 'fat as [expletive]'

When the conversation turned offensive, a beauty queen in an adjoining room started to record the conversation. In addition to the fat comment, friends of Ms Davuluri can be heard making racist comments.

Ms Davuluri is the first Indian-American to serve as Miss New York and has nicknamed herself 'Miss Diversity'.

**Celebration: Nina Davuluri was crowned Miss New York on July 16.**

After her win, she invited friends back to her hotel room to celebrate and that's when another competitor overheard her make the fat comment.

'Miss Diversity': Ms Davuluri was the first Indian-American to win the Miss New York title, but friends in her hotel room were overheard making racist comments

Following the incident, Ms Davuluri apologized for her friends' comments on Facebook, but said she did nothing wrong.

'I want to apologize for the awful statements made by people in my room...There were people who claimed to be my supporters and said things I never agreed with, nor supported,' Ms Davuluri wrote. 'I was never a part of the words or statements that may have been hurtful...I'm sorry if someone said something that was inappropriate.'

A representative for Ms Hagan said that the situation was investigated in July and that there is 'no validity to the story whatsoever'.

'Miss New York spoke to Mallory Hagan to let her know there was no validity and to apologize if she was offended in any way,' the rep said.

Ms Hagan was photographed on a beach in Hawaii this past spring, having put on a few pounds since being crowned Miss America. She addressed her weight gain on Anderson Cooper Live saying:

'Well you know I think that I am human I like to equate getting ready for the Miss America pageant to getting ready for a boxing match. We get in shape and then afterwords life goes back to normal.'

Post-competition: Pictures taken of Ms Hagan on vacation in Hawaii last March show that she's filled out a little since the competition

She stressed that being healthy is all about balance.

'It's all about being healthy, we're all about living a healthy lifestyle. Some days you want to eat potatoes and some days you don't.'

And Ms Davuluri herself wasn't always as svelte as she looked in last Tuesday's swimsuit competition.

The Central New Yorker told the Syracuse Post-Standard that she was 60 pounds heavier during her final semesters at the University of Michigan and struggled with bulimia.

Her own weight issues: Ms Davuluri says she was about 60 pounds heavier during her final semesters at University of Michigan, and that she has struggled with bulimia in the past

One day she looked at a picture of herself and finally realized just how much weight she had put on. She thought to herself:

'This is not who I want to be, and it is not the way I want to portray myself to the world.'

So upon entering the beauty pageant world, she got a personal trainer and started eating healthy.

She said she doesn't give out her weight, fearing that other women would try to make that their goal. However, she says her current weight is hardly what she'd define as 'skinny'.

Not skinny: Ms Davuluri doesn't give out her weight for fear that other women will use it as a goal. She says her current weight is hardly what she'd define as 'skinny'

Both Ms Hagan and Ms Davuluri competed against each other in the Miss New York competition, with Ms Hagan being crowned Miss America last year.

The new Miss America will be crowned this Sunday.","Nina Davuluri, Miss New York, was overheard last July calling Miss America Mallory Hagan 'fat as [expletive]'

After the incident, Ms. Davuluri apologized for the racist comments but denied making any herself.

## A Metal Detectorist's Discovery
An elaborate 300-year-old ring, discovered in mud in a maize field, has been officially classified as treasure.

### The Ring's History Unfolds
Metal detectorist Ron Pitman, of Swansea, found the gold and silver ring on farmland in Gower. The ring’s outer surface is engraved with a trellis-style pattern, while its inner surface is inscribed with the words 'prepared bee to follow me’.

## Dating the Ring
The extra e in ‘be’ was said to have been a common feature during the mid to late 1600s. This led experts to believe that the ring was made during this time period.

### The Discovery Story
Metal detectorist Ron Pitman, of Swansea, found the gold and silver ring (pictured) in 2010. The ring’s outer surface is engraved with a trellis-style pattern, while its inner surface is inscribed with ‘prepared bee to follow me’. Mr. Pitman discovered the ring in a field used to grow maize that had been ploughed and rolled, in October 2010.

## Technical Details
The ring is said to be made up of around 81 per cent gold and 9 per silver. It resembles a mourning ring, which was a type of jewelry popular during the Middle Ages.

### Mourning Rings: A Brief History
Reports of mourning rings were first seen during the Middle Ages, but became more common during the 17th century. The estimated value of the ring was not disclosed, but Mr Pitman will receive a finder’s fee. This fee, will also be split with the landowners.

## Expert Analysis
Mark Redknapp of the Department of Archaeology and Numismatics at the National Museum in Cardiff who examined the ring, said: ‘Such rings can be difficult to date but the decoration and sentiments in this case suggests a 17th rather than 18th century date. 

### The Ring's Significance
‘It is my opinion that as an object which has at least 10 per cent by weight precious metal which is at least 300 years old. ‘The ring therefore is treasure.’

## Additional Context
There have been previous examples of rings found in the UK with similar engravings, such as ‘Wee part to meete’, dated to 1658.

### The Ring's Resemblance to a Fictional Work
The Gower ring also bears a resemblance to the fictional ring seen in the Lord of the Rings (pictured).

## New Ownership
The 17th century jewellery was officially classified as treasure at a hearing in Swansea earlier today, and is now the property of the Crown.

### A Potential Future Home
The acting coroner said Swansea Museum has since expressed an interest in bidding for the ring.","The ring’s outer surface is engraved with a trellis-style pattern .

Wellington Gavin and Erickson Villa left school Friday afternoon to play in Starlight Park when the tragic accident happened. Villa was allegedly the first to jump in, and didn't know how to swim. His cousin jumped after to help him, but struggled in the currents as well.

Too young: **Erickson Villa, 13 (left)**, drowned in the Bronx River on Friday. His cousin Wellington Gavin, 13 (right), died Sunday after jumping into the river to save the struggling relative.

Emergency responders arrived on the scene around 3:14pm, at which point the boys had been in the water for roughly 30 minutes. One boy was removed at 3:37pm, followed by the other nearly an hour later. Both were unconscious when they were pulled from the water. Villa died that day while Gavin initially improved at Children's Center Montefiore Hospital. However, by Sunday his conditioned worsened so much that his mother was preparing to take him off life support. Gavin's heart stopped on its own before life support was taken away.

Emergency responders arrived on the scene at 3:14pm and pulled one of the boy's bodies out about **20 minutes later**. The other boy was pulled out an hour after that. Both were unconscious when they were pulled from the water. Gavin was rushed to the hospital but his condition deteriorated by Sunday and his heart stopped beating.

Gavin's family have been speaking to the public through their church pastor, Rev Joel Bauza. On Sunday, Rev Bauza announced Gavin's untimely passing and said they his family had decided to donate his organs to science as a tribute to his 'act of heroism'. Rev Bauza also said the family hopes top protect other children from falling prey to the river.

While there are signs showing that swimming is prohibited in that part of the park, new boat docks have become a favorite gathering spot of the neighborhood's children. '**The family has a lot of concerns about the park safety and they want to address that**,' Rev Bauza said.

8b49d60d388b2f560cf29e6c0a621f062213e461,"**President Barack Obama on Sunday urged Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to agree to an 'immediate, unconditional humanitarian ceasefire' with Hamas.**

The White House says Obama expressed 'strong condemnation' of Hamas' attacks on Israel and again supported Israel's right to defend herself but implored Netanyahu to abide by a permanent ceasefire between his country and the terrorist group.

**Obama's call with the world leader followed Israel's rejection on Friday of a new ceasefire agreement with Hamas negotiated by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry.**

Afterward, an Israeli news report quoted 'voices' from the latter leader's cabinet describing Kerry as 'completely capitulating' to Hamas and 'negligent,' and a top Israeli journalist compared Kerry to a space alien - characterizations that had the Obama administration 'fuming' on Monday, according to the Associated Press.

**The White House is none too happy with deprecating comments made over the weekend by Israeli ministers about Secretary of State John Kerry's negotiating skills.**

In a post on liberal news publication Haaretz's website over the weekend, diplomatic correspondent Barack Ravid said Kerry did more to 'thwart the possibility of reaching a cease-fire in Gaza' than he did to promote one.

He went on to say Kerry would be 'responsible for every additional drop of blood that is spilled' if his actions resulted in an escalation of Israeli military aggression.

**'Kerry isn’t anti-Israeli; on the contrary, he’s a true friend to Israel,' Ravid wrote.**

**Fighting resumed between Israel and Hamas on Sunday morning as the clock ran out on a temporary ceasefire that put the nearly three weeks old armed conflict on hold for a half day.**

Appearing on CNN's State of the Union on Sunday morning, Netanyahu reaffirmed his country's refusal of Hamas' ultimatum and chastised his enemies' violation of previously agreed upon ceasefires.

**'Israel is doing what any country would do, and certainly what the U.S. would do,' Netanyahu said.**

The White House says Obama called the Israeli Prime Minster that afternoon and told him 'ultimately' a long-term solution 'must ensure the disarmament of terrorist groups and the demilitarization of Gaza.'

**However, the White House says Obama shared the administration's 'serious and growing concern about the rising number of Palestinian civilian deaths and the loss of Israeli lives, as well as the worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza.'**

As of Sunday, more than a thousand Palestinians had been killed in the conflict and up to 6,000 others had been injured, according to AP.

Nearly four dozen Israeli soldiers and three civilians have also been killed.

**In excerpts of an interview with Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal that aired on CBS on Sunday and Monday, Meshaal told Charlie Rose that 'the world has two choices' - to help Hamas 'peacefully' remove Israel from the West Bank and the Gaza strip or 'we will expel this occupation from our land.'**

**Hamas will keep fighting the 'occupiers,' he said, until it is victorious.**

'I can die because of Israel. I cannot live under the occupation. The occupation is the worst thing that you can ever imagine,' he said.

'So every single Palestinian can die for the next generations to live in peace and freedom.'

**Mashaal danced around whether Hamas would 'coexist with the state of Israel' if Palestine had its own state before telling Rose, 'When we have a Palestinian state, then the Palestinian state will decide on its policies,' adding that the 'Palestinian people can have their say, when they have their own state, without occupation.'**

United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon said today that both Netanyahu and Mashaal were responsible for the conflict.

**The U.N. Human Rights report is a joke,** said Senator Graham in comments reported by Politico.

'The U.N. is becoming anti-Israeli, anti-Semitic.'

**Will they ever forgive him?: One Israeli journalist compared Kerry to a space alien after he failed to successfully negotiate a permanent ceasefire between Israel and Hamas last week.**

Throughout Israel it was Secretary Kerry who was the subject of mockery in weekend commentary.

Maariv columnist Ben Caspit called Kerry 'an ongoing embarrassment, with the characteristics of a snowball.'

'The further he rolls, the greater the embarrassment,' Caspit said.

**Israeli TV reporter Udi Segal ran a report citing government officials who framed Kerry as 'incapable of handling the most basic matters.'**

The Associated Press said Monday that Obama administration officials said on background that by ridiculing Kerry, Israeli ministers 'crossed a line' and relations between Israel and the U.S. may never be as close as it once was as a result.

**In on the record comments Deputy National Security Adviser Tony Blinken came to Kerry's defense.**

'Israel has no better friend, no stronger defender than John Kerry,' he told AP.

The comments about Kerry are 'people leaking things that are either misinformed, or attempting to misinform,' he claimed.","Obama wants Israel to agree to an 'immediate, unconditional humanitarian ceasefire' with Hamas .

UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon joined Obama in calling for an immediate humanitarian cease-fire, saying both Netanyahu and Hamas were morally wrong for allowing the death and destruction to continue. Over 1,000 Palestinians have been killed, and nearly four dozen Israeli soldiers and civilians have also died in the conflict."

**Donations Soar to £1.5million**

The donations to a fund set up to help rebuild the home soared to nearly £1.5 million, boosted by a pledge of £25,000 from X Factor guru Simon Cowell. The money was raised despite some controversy surrounding a joke made by Coronation Street actor Jack P Shepherd about the fire on Twitter.

830ddcd1e1bbb14e0b069b7c738b8387e3671419,"**Brian Williams Steps Down from NBC Nightly News Amid Scandal**

Brian Williams has announced that he is temporarily stepping down as anchor of the NBC Nightly News. The 55-year-old Managing Editor made the announcement in a statement on Saturday, citing concerns that he has become ""too much a part of the news"" due to his recent controversies.

**Controversy Unfolds Over False Story**

Williams' decision comes after it was revealed that he had fabricated a story about being on a helicopter that was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade in Iraq in 2003. He had previously claimed that the aircraft he was on was struck, but later recanted his account after veterans who were actually on the chopper called him out.

**Other Scandals Emerge**

Williams has also been accused of fabricating elements of his time reporting from New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina. He claimed to have seen a body floating down the street and contracted dysentery from flood water, but these claims have been met with skepticism.

**Lester Holt to Take Over**

In light of the scandal, Lester Holt will be taking over as anchor of the NBC Nightly News for the next several days. Holt has previously covered for Williams on occasion, including when he was having knee surgery in 2013.

**Internal Probe Launched**

NBC has launched an internal probe into Williams' actions, led by top investigative journalist Richard Esposito. The network is also facing scrutiny from rival ABC, which is reportedly reviewing old footage of Williams to see if there are any other instances where he fabricated stories.

**Katie Couric Eyes Return to NBC**

Former NBC anchor Katie Couric has been mentioned as a potential replacement for Williams in the future. Couric currently anchors Yahoo! Global News and has deep contacts within NBC.

**Lester Holt's Background**

Lester Holt, who is taking over as anchor of the NBC Nightly News, has a long history with the network. He began his career at CBS in 1981 and joined NBC in 2005, where he became a substitute anchor for the Nightly News and Today show.

**Holt's Past Mistakes**

Despite his current success, Holt has not been immune to mistakes in the past. In 2012, he overslept and had to be woken up by an executive producer before going on air with the Weekend Today show. He also got lost on a train ride during coverage of the London Olympics and ended up in Scotland.

**Holt's Experience**

Holt has covered major events for NBC, including the London Olympics and the Sochi Winter Olympics. In 2014, he downed a shot of vodka with co-host Natalie Morales while covering the Sochi games. Despite these experiences, Holt remains confident in his abilities to anchor the Nightly News.

**Timeline**

A bomb squad was forced to blow up a wartime explosive in a field after discovering a cache of guns, ammunition, and grenades in a man's garage this morning. Army experts were called to the semi-detached house in St Albans, Hertfordshire, this evening after police sealed off the property having discovered the hoard of historic weaponry.

A planned explosion was carried out in a nearby field as a 48-year-old man, named locally as Alan Tissington, was arrested on suspicion of stealing from a prisoner of war camp in the UK. Bomb disposal robots were sent into the home this morning where police found a vast collection of war memorabilia including guns, artillery shells, mortar bombs, gas masks and uniforms from the First and Second World Wars.

Police who raided a house in a Hertfordshire street found a cache of firearms and ammunition in the garage. After the raid, police laid out some of the firearms and ammunition they had found at the man's house.

Arranged against the far wall of the garage housing the memorabilia was a collection of artillery shells. Army experts carried out a controlled explosion in a field near the house this afternoon in St Albans. Hertfordshire Police confirmed a number of detonations were carried out this afternoon in the field.

Forensics experts worked to catalogue the munitions they found, which included bullets and rifles. A garage behind the property stored a treasure trove of memorabilia - and munitions - from the world wars. A man, 46, was arrested on suspicion of theft of explosives before bomb disposal robots went into his house.

Police and army officers were accompanied by experts from English Heritage as they searched the house, outbuildings and garden. Hertfordshire Police, who insisted the raid was not terrorism-related, said it may be necessary to remain at the house for up to 48 hours as they carry out work to establish the safety of the devices found today.

Chief Inspector Ken Townsend, of Hertfordshire Police, said: 'This seizure is on an unprecedented scale and it will be a long process. It is an extremely large collection. Although the items seized today are potentially dangerous, there is no danger to members of the public.'

Officers suspect the man of illegally metal detecting on sites of historic importance, including a former Second World War PoW camp in Batford, near Harpenden. It is a criminal offence to retrieve artefacts from the ground after finding them with a metal detector if the land is a protected site or without permission of the landowner.

The large camp was home to around 600 prisoners of war, most of them Italian or German, until around 1947. Hertfordshire Police said they had intelligence to suggest that the man living at the property with his family had been building up a collection of WW1 and WW2 artefacts. Officers believe the man, who neighbours described as a military enthusiast, had travelled to sites all over Britain and Europe in the search for memorabilia.

Hand grenades, shell covers, incendiary bombs, and stick grenades were among the munitions discovered.

Dozens of police officers, accompanied by army bomb disposal experts and sniffer dogs filled the street. The garage contained a vast collection of memorabilia including uniforms, gas masks, helmets and wreaths.

The firearms were found in a garage to the side of the semi-detached house after today's early morning raid. This Vicker's belt-fed machine gun was among the items seized by police at the house in St Albans today.

## Wenger Concerned About Striker's Long-Term Injury

Arsene Wenger fears that Olivier Giroud will be ruled out until the New Year, leaving Arsenal to consider a late plunge into the transfer market before Monday’s deadline. 

### A Freak Injury

Wenger tried to push concerns aside to avoid distractions ahead of Wednesday’s Champions League play-off second leg against Besiktas but admitted Giroud could face a long time out after a freak injury.

The striker was hurt when the ball smashed into the sole of his boot in the final seconds of Saturday’s 2-2 draw at Everton, pushing the toe-end of the foot upwards towards the shin, causing a small fracture near his ankle.

Giroud went down with an ankle injury late on against Everton on Saturday. 

### Firepower: Giroud Scores Arsenal's Equaliser

Firepower: Giroud scored Arsenal's equaliser in the hard-fought 2-2 draw with Everton on Saturday.

## ‘I Still Don’t Understand How He Did It’

‘I still don’t understand how he did it,’ said Arsenal manager Wenger. ‘The problem I think is his tibia. He over-stretched his ankle that way. It was on the ball, not a contact.

Giroud will be assessed again by a specialist on Wednesday but when asked if it looked like a long-term injury, Wenger replied: ‘It can be, we’ll see. It’s sad for us, but for the moment we are focused on this game. 

### We Have Started the Season Quite Well

We have started the season quite well, with three good games. We want to continue to grow and win our games.’

## Arsenal Without Captain Mikel Arteta

Arsenal are also without captain Mikel Arteta, who twisted an ankle in the goalless first leg and influential midfielder Aaron Ramsey, who is banned after a red card in Istanbul.

Kieran Gibbs has a hamstring problem and Theo Walcott, out since January with a knee injury, will not be rushed back, with both set to return after next month’s international break.","Arsenal face Besiktas on Wednesday in Champions League play-off second leg at the Emirates after 0-0 draw in Turkey last week .

## Sophie Walton, 21, from Upminster in Havering, was diagnosed with bone cancer in 2011.

*By Lizzie Parry for MailOnline*

Sophie Walton took the brave but life-saving decision to amputate her leg below the knee after doctors warned the disease could spread. By the time the disease was detected it had already spread to her lungs.

## Specialists Told Her Only Chance of Survival Was To Remove Her Right Leg Below The Knee

Without hesitation, Miss Walton agreed, putting her faith in her medical team, and has since been told she is free of the disease.

## Sophie's Story

Sophie first spotted a lump on her right foot after a night out with friends. Doctors thought she had broken her foot - something an X-ray later confirmed, but when the bone failed to heal properly, she was given an MRI scan which highlighted an abnormal growth.

*By the time her bone cancer was diagnosed it had already spread to her lungs.*

Just one week after her surgeon delivered the shocking news that she may need her leg amputation, the operation went ahead. She said: 'I was pain free when I woke up but I didn't feel relieved.'

## A Life-Changing Decision

Miss Walton made the brave decision to trial a new drug - a stronger form of chemotherapy, that could save her life but would leave her infertile. 'I had to give myself the best chance of survival,' she said.

## Overcoming Adversity

After finishing her trial drug treatment Miss Walton's health took another turn for the worst. She had a low liver function and her gall bladder had become inflamed. Doctors diagnosed her with veno-occlusive disease (VOD) - a condition in which some of the small veins in the liver are obstructed and is a known complication of high-dose chemotherapy.

## A Bright Future Ahead

But after a year of operations and treatment, in January 2013, Miss Walton was given the amazing news that the trial chemotherapy drug had worked, 90 per cent of the cancer in her lungs had disappeared. In February, she underwent an operation to remove the remaining cancer nobles from her lungs.

## Back To Normal

Two weeks later she was given the all clear. 'I had check-ups every two months to begin with but now it's every three,' she said. 'I also see a reproductive doctor as the chemo has left me completely infertile.'

## Support From Loved Ones

But with the support of her mother, Debra, 53, father, Steve, 59, step-dad, Richard, 52, and her two sisters, Rhyanna, 26 and Lara, 28, Miss Walton is now looking forward to the future.

## A New Chapter

She said: 'I've enrolled to do veterinary care at college this month which I can't wait to start. 'I have been on holiday a few times since losing my leg too. I know I'll be back wearing shorter dresses in no time.'

## Julie Harrington, Bone Cancer Research Trust Chief Executive Officer

Julie Harrington said: 'Sophie's fight back to fitness after her bone cancer diagnosis and amputation is a real triumph and inspiration, not only for her friend Mark, who will run in her honour, but also for others facing bone cancer.'","Sophie Walton was diagnosed with bone cancer in 2011 after discovering a lump on her foot months after breaking her leg .

After a year of treatment, including a rare complication that required six weeks in hospital, Sophie was given the all-clear in 2013.

The story highlights the bravery and resilience of someone diagnosed with bone cancer and the importance of research and awareness to improve outcomes for patients affected by this devastating disease."
c34b0d88c4c522da791c2304dd5ba641c3333df4,"**A Story of Ethnic Violence, Extreme Guilt, and Reconciliation**

Associated Press

She lost her baby daughter and her right hand to a manic killing spree. He wielded the machete that took both. Yet today, despite coming from opposite sides of an unspeakable shared past, Alice Mukarurinda and Emmanuel Ndayisaba are friends.

She is the treasurer and he the vice president of a group that builds simple brick houses for genocide survivors. They live near each other and shop at the same market. Their story of ethnic violence, extreme guilt, and, to some degree, reconciliation is the story of Rwanda today, 20 years after its Hutu majority killed more than 1 million Tutsis and moderate Hutus.

The Rwandan government is still accused of attempting to cover up the genocide, with many Hutus denying that it ever occurred. Alice worries that some genocide planners were never caught, and that messages denying the genocide still filter into the country from Hutus living abroad. She believes remembrance is important to ensure that another genocide never happens.

For Emmanuel, the anniversary periods bring back the nightmares. He looks like a man serving penance, who does not want to talk but feels he must. 'I've been asking myself why I acted like a fool, listening to such words, that this person is bad and that person is bad,' Emmanuel says. 'The same people that encouraged the genocide are the ones saying there was no genocide.'

He, too, worries that the embers of the genocide still smolder. 'The problem is still there,' Emmanuel says. 'There are Hutus who hate me for telling the truth. There are those up until now who participated in the genocide who deny they took part.'

**A Story of Forgiveness**

In this March 2014 photo, Rwandans are seen reflected in the windows of an office building going about their daily business.

Although Rwanda has made significant progress since the genocide, ethnic tensions remain. 'We had attended workshops and trainings and our hearts were kind of free, and I found it easy to forgive,' says Josephine Munyeli, director of peace and reconciliation programs in Rwanda for World Vision.

A survivor of the genocide herself, Munyeli says more killers and victims would like to reconcile but many don't know who they attacked or were attacked by. 'Forgiveness is possible. It's common here,' she says. 'Guilt is heavy. When one realizes how heavy it is the first thing they do to recuperate themselves is apologize.'

**A Story of Survival**

She was bloodied, scarred, and missing a hand, yes, but not dead. Alice fell unconscious, she says, and was found three days later by other survivors.

It was only then that she realized she no longer had a right hand. In the months after the genocide, guilt gnawed away at Emmanuel. He saw his victims during nightmares. In 1996, he turned himself in and confessed. His prison term lasted from 1997 until 2003, when Kagame pardoned Hutus who admitted their guilt.

After he was freed, he began asking family members of his victims for forgiveness. He joined a group of genocide killers and survivors called Ukurrkuganze, who still meet weekly. It was there that he saw Alice, the woman he thought he had killed. At first he avoided her. Eventually he kneeled before her and asked for forgiveness.

After two weeks of thought and long discussions with her husband, she said yes. 'We had attended workshops and trainings and our hearts were kind of free, and I found it easy to forgive,' says Alice. 'The Bible says you should forgive and you will also be forgiven.'","Tutsi Alice Mukarurinda's hand was amputated and her baby was killed by Emmanuel Ndayisaba, a Hutu, in 1994 .
On Monday Rwanda marks the 20th anniversary of the beginning of 100 days of bloody mayhem .
Hutus resented Tutsis for their greater wealth and what they saw as oppressive rule .
Emmanuel turned himself in and confessed for his crimes in 1996 .
Prison term lasted from 1997 until 2003, when Hutus who admitted their guilt were pardoned .
Emmanuel and Alice live near each other and shop at the same market .
Emmanuel kneeled before Alice and asked for forgiveness -- and after two weeks of thought she said yes .","In Rwanda, two decades after the 1994 genocide that killed over 1 million Tutsis and moderate Hutus, former enemies Alice Mukarurinda and Emmanuel Ndayisaba have formed an unlikely friendship. In 1994, Emmanuel, then 23, was ordered to kill a family of Tutsis by local Hutu leaders and carried out the massacre, also killing a doctor and two women with their child. Alice survived but lost her baby daughter and right hand to Emmanuel's machete. After serving in prison for six years, Emmanuel began seeking forgiveness from his victims' families, including Alice, whom he had thought killed. The two now work together on a project to help genocide survivors and perpetrators reconcile, with many Rwandans demonstrating remarkable capacity for forgiveness despite the trauma of their past."

### A Woman Set to Give Birth from a Transplanted Womb

#### A Breakthrough in Medicine

A woman is set to become the first in the world to give birth from a transplanted womb after doctors successfully implanted an embryo into her body. This remarkable achievement marks a significant milestone in the field of medicine, offering new hope to thousands of childless women across Europe and at least 15,000 in the UK.

#### A Woman Born Without a Womb

The unnamed woman was born without a womb, suffering from MRKH syndrome, a congenital disorder that prevents the development of the womb. However, she still has intact ovaries that produce eggs, which can be fertilized outside her body and implanted into her transplanted womb.

#### A Transplant Operation Ahead of Its Time

The woman was one of nine to undergo a womb transplant in Sweden between September 2012 and April last year. The surgery involved transferring an embryo grown from the woman's own egg into her transplanted womb, which was donated by her mother. This innovative procedure means that any child she has through IVF would be genetically her own.

#### A New Era for Childless Women

This groundbreaking achievement opens up new possibilities for childless women who were previously unable to bear children due to uterine infertility. The Swedish team's success has sparked hope for thousands of women across Europe and beyond, offering a chance for them to fulfill their deep-seated yearning to have a baby.

#### A Procedure Marked by Controversy

While the breakthrough is celebrated, it is essential to acknowledge that the method involves taking wombs from living donors. This has sparked controversy among some surgeons who believe that putting a living donor through such a major operation is not justifiable unless life-saving. Nevertheless, the Swedish team favors this approach due to the better condition and immunological match of the organs.

#### A New Option for British Women

The development has also prompted Womb Transplant UK to consider using wombs from dead donors. The charity is ready to give five British women wombs from deceased donors, subject to receiving ethical clearance and raising the necessary funds.

#### An Uncertain Future

While the Swedish team is optimistic about the success of this procedure, it's essential to acknowledge that there are still uncertainties surrounding its viability. Experts caution that the biggest worry is how well a transplanted womb will cope with the strains of pregnancy. The operation will only be considered a success on the birth of a healthy baby.

#### A Historic Achievement in the Making

As the world watches this historic achievement unfold, one thing is certain: it marks a significant step forward for medicine and offers new hope to childless women across the globe. Will this procedure prove to be a game-changer, or will it remain confined to research and limited experimentation? Only time will tell.","Woman suffers from MRKH syndrome - a congenital disorder which prevents the womb from developing, but doesn't impact the ovaries .
She was one of nine women to undergo a womb transplant in Sweden .
Doctors have transferred an embryo grown from her own egg to her womb .
She will have to wait to see if the embryo embeds in the uterine wall to find out whether she is in fact pregnant .

This means any child she has through IVF would be genetically her own. If successful, this would be a groundbreaking achievement, providing hope to thousands of childless women across Europe and beyond. The procedure is not without controversy, however, as it involves taking wombs from living donors. A successful birth would prove that womb transplants are a viable option for women with uterine infertility, but critics argue the risks are too great and some women should accept they will never bear children."

The girlfriend of a Texas man who was aboard the missing Malaysian Airlines plane has revealed how she anxiously waited at their home in China for the flight that never arrived.

**Sarah Bajc**, who is also an American expat, said the desperate wait for information about her long-term boyfriend **Philip Wood** was 'one of the most painful things I have ever had to go through'.

She had sent a car to Beijing Airport to collect Wood, who worked in Beijing for IBM, as he returned from a trip visiting family in Texas.

As she waited, she tracked his journey on the airline's website.

> ""The online site tracker said it was just delayed; that it took off on time but that it hadn't landed.""

Bajc, 48, told CBS News.

Waiting for news: Sarah Bajc, left, was at home in Beijing when she learned that the plane flying her boyfriend Philip Wood, right, back to her was missing.

She can now do nothing but wait for information.

> ""Then I looked at the online news, and there was the news that the plane was missing.""

The lack of consistency of information has been incredibly frustrating and confusing.'

She persevered and found a press release saying the airport had lost contact with the plane and that loved ones should call a number, which she tried 'on and off for several hours'.

> ""Finally they contacted me since I was listed as next of kin, and they were able to tell me nothing other than the fact that they lost contact.""

I queried them about the various news reports that I'd seen online, first there was a reported landing, then there was a reported wreckage, then the oil spill and the passports, and they literally cannot confirm any of it.'

But Bajc, who was hoping to move to Kuala Lumpur with Wood, 50, in the near future as he relocated for a new assignment with IBM, said she was glad that they did not respond to these speculations.

Family: Wood is pictured with his two sons, **Chris** and **Nick**, who said 'odds are' they won't see him again.

Sadness: The men said they accepted they might never see Wood again but that they would always hold hope.

Heartbroken: Wood's father broke down as he recounted his son's love of travel and 'big heart'

> ""The rest of the news media and social media that keep pushing out this false information are really making this an awful roller coaster for those involved.""

But Bajc added that knowing nothing about the flight gave her hope.

> ""I'm personally not willing to give up hope that there's a chance we'll find survivors, that we'll find the plane.""

There just has to be a chance.'

Wood was one of three Americans who were aboard the Boeing 777 when it lost contact with air traffic control.

The family has been contacted by the U.S. Department of State and the embassy in Malaysia.

A second brother, **Tom Wood**, said the events have left 'a real hole in our family,' but he said they aren't giving up hope.

> ""You never know.'

I'm not gonna close that door until we need to close it completely.'""

So far, no explanation as to what happened to the plane is available.

There was no distress signal before the plane vanished from the radar.

The family said they are watching CNN, BBC and other news stations, waiting for small pieces of information on anything about the missing plane.

BBC chairman Lord Patten faced renewed calls to resign yesterday after he accused a parliamentary committee of ‘shabby’ treatment when it criticised ex-director-general George Entwistle’s bumper payoff.

## The Tory peer clashed with Labour MP Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, over a report which attacked the ‘cavalier’ use of public money to give Mr Entwistle a ‘reward for failure’ after a mere 54 days in the job. 

Lord Patten accused MPs of ‘taking no notice’ of 12 pages of legal advice the BBC Trust had supplied – which he said showed it would have faced a bigger payout had they not agreed the deal.

## Defence: 
BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten has maintained that the package was a good deal for taxpayers

In a scattergun approach, he attacked MPs, the NHS and the Press, and said his hands were tied by the corporation’s lawyers. He suggested some newspapers, naming the Daily Mail and Daily Telegraph, were overly critical of the payout although he seemed finally to accept that Mr Entwistle was the ‘wrong man’.

## On Mr Entwistle’s appointment to the job of Director General, he added: 
‘With the benefit of hindsight, we chose the wrong one. But we chose him from a very distinguished field. 'It was the unanimous choice of the whole of the BBC Trust.’ 

He defended the BBC’s approach to the Jimmy Savile scandal – saying it had acted more swiftly than the National Health Service in response to the revelations about the TV presenter’s sordid past.

## The NHS, which has received allegations from former patients at three trusts, has still to start formal inquiries into what went wrong. 

Miss Hodge said the BBC chairman should accept there might be ‘different views’ about his decision to rush through a generous deal with Mr Entwistle, adding: ‘He may not be right.’ 

She pointed out that there had been a **culture of generous settlements** to former executives, including former chief operating officer Caroline Thomson who received £670,000 earlier this year after she was passed over for the director general’s job. 

‘They just don’t get it,’ she said.

## Scandal: 
George Entwistle (left) was paid £450,000 to leave the BBC after 54 days in the job - which Public Accounts Committee chairman Margaret Hodge (right) says was an unacceptable amount

Senior Labour backbencher Barry Sheerman said he was shocked by Lord Patten’s comments, saying the remarks ‘merits his resignation’.

Last month Mr Entwistle was given a full year’s salary – £450,000 – double what he was entitled to ensure a speedy resignation amid the crisis caused by Newsnight’s dropped Savile investigation and the botched report which wrongfully linked Lord McAlpine to the abuse of children.

## His deal also provided 
*   a year’s private healthcare
*   fees for lawyers
*   even £10,000 to pay for Press advice

The PAC said the deal was ‘out of line both with public expectations and what is considered acceptable elsewhere in the public sector’.

MPs also criticised ‘excessive’ severance payments to ten other senior managers, including Miss Thomson.

## On Radio 4’s Today programme, the BBC chairman said: 
‘You are not supposed to criticise the Public Accounts Committee ... in politics it is sort of the equivalent of swearing in church. The Public Accounts Committee - “I do think the treatment we have had is shabby”.’

Lord Patten said the BBC has taken legal advice on whether it can recoup some of the £450,000 payoff given to Mr Entwistle, but was not hopeful.

*One of the Muslim leaders called to a meeting with Australian Federal Police as the Sydney siege unfolded, is in no doubt that gunman Man Haron Monis would have surrendered, if he had been allowed to talk with him.*

# The Story Behind

Keysar Trad, one of the Muslim leaders called to a meeting with Australian Federal Police as the Sydney siege unfolded, is in no doubt that gunman Man Haron Monis would have surrendered, if he had been allowed to talk with him.

**The Meeting**

""They could have let someone like me talk with him, someone who had met him before, I knew him and I would have got him to surrender, I am fairly confident,"" Mr Trad said. He said neither his offer nor that of other community leaders made during the day, including that of Australia's most senior Muslim cleric the Grand Mufti, was accepted.

**The Offer**

Further, he added, they were not sought out for any advice as it dragged on. ""I was saying it all day, let us help.""

**Background**

Islamic Friendship Association founder Keysar Trad is pictured on his way to a meeting with government officials last year to discuss the counter-terrorism laws. He says police should have involved Muslim leaders in negotiations with Sydney siege gunman Man Haron Monis.

**Previous Incidents**

The same year in which Sydney Siege gunman Man Monis (left) was dropped from the national watch lists, it’s been revealed he was also reported to AFP for repeatedly threatening an Islamic school principal. Islamic Friendship Association founder Keysar Trad said police should have let him talk to the hostage-taker during the Martin Place Lindt cafe stand-off last month.

**The Meeting with Police**

It's believed among those represented at the Monday morning (December 15) briefing with the Australian Federal Police, which was in relation to anti-terror raids and not the early stages of the siege, were representatives of the Islamic Friendship Association, Islamic Council of New South Wales, the United Muslim Women's Association, Lebanese Muslim Association, the Muslim Village and a former AFP official of Muslim background.

**The Tense Moments**

Word of the drama in Sydney's CBD had begun to filter through to the 10am gathering at a Bankstown hotel in the city's south-west and those involved in the meeting say they made it known they wanted to be involved, if required. The official briefing was quickly wound up but Mr Trad, who is the founder of the Islamic Friendship Association, revealed that there were tense scenes even as the meeting came to an end.

**The Last Moments**

He said some at the gathering disagreed over the potential level of involvement from the Muslim community, saying 'we had an argument'. Vision inside the Lindt cafe of long gunman Man Haron Monis during the 17-hour stand-off. He took 18 hostages.

**The Aftermath**

More than 100,000 bouquets were placed at the shrine in Martin Place in the days after the siege. The flowers placed in memory of the Lindt cafe siege hostages will feature as part of a permanent memorial, after having been mulched.

**The Reflections**

""It's been revealed the Grand Mufti of Australia, Dr Ibrahim Abu Mohammad, was ready to become involved but was not sought for advice nor involved at an official level, with senior police admitting at the time that even 11 hours into the stand-off there had been limited, if any, contact directly with the gunman.

**The Different Views**

While others suggest police erred in not taking advice from Muslim community leaders, Ahmed Kilani of the Muslim Village sees it differently saying ""I can't really find any fault in what they have done. They were being very, very careful not to risk people's lives"".","Muslim leader insist Man Haron Monis 'would have surrendered'
The founder of Islamic Friendship Association says he could have stopped the bloodshed, if police had taken up the Muslim community's offer to help .
Prominent members of Australia's Muslim community were locked in counter-terror raid briefings in Sydney's south-west when the siege began .
AFP officers were told 'all our resources are available' but no member of the Muslim community was consulted during the 17 hour stand-off .
There was also a tense debate at the morning meeting between Islamic representatives as to whether they should get involved .
The meeting with the AFP at Bankstown began at 10am and was shut down before 11 as the siege situation at Martin Place heightened .","Keysar Trad, a Muslim leader, claims that gunman Man Haron Monis would have surrendered if allowed to talk with him during the Sydney siege. Trad and other community leaders offered to help negotiate with Monis, but their offers were not accepted by police. Trad believes that allowing someone he knew, like himself, to speak with Monis could have prevented bloodshed. He also expressed frustration that officials were selective in who was told vital information about Monis' identity, and that he was not included despite his offer to sign a waiver accepting responsibility for his actions if harmed by the gunman. Trad's comments come as authorities continue to investigate the siege and its aftermath."

### By Lizzie Parry
#### PUBLISHED: 07:37 EST, 6 February 2014 | UPDATED: 07:38 EST, 6 February 2014

An Orthodox Jewish woman has finally won her freedom after a two-year battle for religious divorce from her husband. Gital Dodelson has been granted a 'get' by her ex-husband Avrohom Meir Weiss, after the pair legally divorced in 2012.

#### A Mother's Fight for Freedom

Gital Dodelson, 25, divorced her husband Avrohom Meir Weiss in 2012. After a four-year battle to be granted a 'get' -  the document that must be signed by a husband for a divorce to be recognized by Jewish law, she has finally won her freedom.

#### The Struggle is Real

The law student, who lives in Lakewood, New Jersey, told the New York Post she divorced Mr Weiss in 2012, but spent years trying to get him to grant her the 'get' - a document that must be signed by a husband for a divorce to be recognised by Jewish law. Without the document, she was seen as an **agunah** - a chained woman - in the eyes of the Orthodox community, who considered her still married to Mr Weiss.

#### A Life in Limbo

The mother-of-one from Lakewood, New Jersey, explained that her husband - whom she said has always been a controlling man - comes from a respected rabbinic family, making it all the more difficult to loosen herself from his power. After numerous attempts to reach an agreement, all met with the same defiance, Ms Dodelson has decided to make her story public in an effort to move on with her life.

#### A Warning Sign

She says she saw signs that Mr Weiss would be a difficult husband just three days into their marriage in 2009, when they spent their first Shabbat together in complete silence. Explaining that the observance is typically a female tradition, she says he lost his temper when she was telling him how it was done in her family.

#### The Red Flags

'When my way contradicted his way, he criticized me and turned angry,' she wrote. Her husband then told her: 'You have no choice. It's not my way' - an attitude he was to exhibit consistently over the following four years. The couple separated within a year of getting married, prompting a bitter battle between their Orthodox families, with Weiss reportedly demanding upwards of $350,000 to settle the matter.

#### A Desperate Plea

Miss Dodelson told the Post, in November: 'On my last mission to ask for a get, a month ago, Avrohom said, ""I can’t give you a get — how else would I control you?"" 'I think that’s the key to it all. He insists the marriage isn’t over until he says it’s over.'

#### A Global Outcry

A Facebook group **Free Gital: Tell Avrohom Meir Weiss to Give His Wife a Get** was set up, attracting more than 14,000 supporters across the world.

#### New Beginnings

Miss Dodelson's publicist, Shira Dicker, said she could not say why Weiss had changed his mind. The Weiss family, when approached for comment, declined. Miss Dicker said Miss Dodelson and her family have vowed to set up a not-for-profit organisation to help other women facing similar problems win their freedom.

#### A New Path

Refusing to grant a get is viewed in Jewish law as domestic abuse, but Mr Weiss had said he would sign only if she rearranged the custody arrangement and gave him $350,000. She added: 'The family isn't just skipping into the sunset. There's a real sense of responsibility here.'

#### A Pattern of Control

Mr Weiss not only took control when it came to religious observances, but also when it came to the couple's finances, despite his wife being the sole breadwinner. When she suggested couples therapy, he refused, and every attempt to communicate was met with silence and hostility.

#### A Mother's Resolve

It was when she became pregnant that she decided to take a stand against her overbearing other half. 'I thought: ""How can I bring a child into this world with a virtual stranger? Someone I'm so disconnected from?""' she said.

#### A New Chapter

Mr Weiss ultimately granted her a divorce - after first attempting to file for sole custody of their son Aryeh. He repeatedly refused to give her a get, something which in Jewish law is viewed as domestic abuse. As a man he was free to date other women, while his ex-wife was stuck in limbo in a community where her moving on would have been classed as adultery.","Gital Dodelson was legally divorced from Avrohom Meir Weiss in 2012 .
But for years he refused to give her a get - the document that must be signed by a husband for a divorce to be recognised by Jewish law .
Without a get, she was still seen as married in her community, and would be ostracised if she were to move on romantically .
Three months after speaking publicly about her struggle the 25-year-old has finally received the document allowing her to move on .
She has vowed to set up a not-for-profit organisation to help other women facing similar problems .","Gital Dodelson, a 25-year-old Orthodox Jewish woman, has finally gained freedom from her controlling husband Avrohom Meir Weiss after a two-year battle for religious divorce. Despite divorcing him in 2012, she was unable to obtain a ""get"" - a document required by Jewish law for a divorce to be recognized - due to Weiss's refusal to grant it. The couple's marriage had been marked by control and abuse, with Weiss exerting power over Dodelson through manipulation of Jewish law. A social media campaign, Free Gital, attracted 14,000 supporters worldwide, putting pressure on Weiss to grant the divorce. After years of resistance, Weiss finally signed the get, allowing Dodelson to move on with her life."

A 36 year old woman who had sex with a 12-year-old boy has been jailed for 10 years.

Joy Leaann McCall, from Ocala, Florida, had sex three times with the young boy who was the same age as her own children. She was given 10 years in prison for each charge of lewd or lascivious battery on a child between 12 and 15 but told the sentence would run concurrently.

**Sentenced: Joy McCall**

McCall pleaded guilty to the second-degree felony charges and was given a 134-day credit for time already spent in jail. The court heard that the 12-year-old, who has not been named, told police that he received Facebook messages from the woman. He said the messages 'continued to get more heated' and he later received photos of her posing in underwear.

**The Affair Unfolds**

McCall arranged to meet the boy at a local shopping mall where she picked him up and ended up having sex in the back seat of her car. The boy claimed he contacted her again five days later. She collected him and drove him to some woods, where they had sex again.

**A Third Encounter**

He claimed they met for a third time on February 16th and had sex in the same wooded area. McCall, a shop worker, later admitted to police she had sex with the boy.

**The Affair is Exposed**

The affair leaked out after the young boy confided in a friend who told the victim's mother, according to the Ocala Star Banner. Police were called after the boy's mom read some of the text messages sent by McCall to her son.

""She was able to see through the different text messaging that had occurred between McCall and the juvenile. And determine the dates that the incidents had occurred,"" Sergeant Angy Scroble told WCJB back in February.","Joy Leaann McCall, 36, had sex three times with the 12-year-old boy who was the same age as her own children .

## Almost 9,500 People Had Knee Replacement Surgery Last Year Due to Obesity

The nation's knees are crumbling under the strain of the obesity crisis, MailOnline can reveal. Almost 9,500 people classed as obese, including two teenagers, underwent knee replacement surgery last year, at a cost of more than £50 million.

## The Numbers Have Surged by 150 Percent in Just Four Years

The numbers have surged by 150 percent in just four years, and raise fresh concerns about the extraordinary cost to the NHS of dealing with expanding waistlines. Almost 9,500 people had knee replacement surgery last year because their joints could not cope with their weight, at a cost of more than £50 million to the NHS.

## Obesity Costs the NHS £5.1 Billion Each Year

Obesity costs the NHS £5.1 billion each year with 40,000 people dying as a result of being overweight or obese. Now it can be revealed that one in 10 patients given new knees is obese, up from one in 20 just four years ago.

## The Problem Will Only Get Worse Unless Urgent Action Is Taken

Tory MP Sarah Wollaston, chairman of the health select committee, warned the problem would only get worse unless urgent action was taken to prevent obesity causing increased disabilities. Data compiled for MailOnline shows how the number of knee operations for obese patients has soared from 3,787 in 2009-10 to 9,438 in 2012-13.

## A Knee Replacement Costs Around £5,500

A knee replacement costs around £5,500, meaning the bill for last year alone could have topped £52 million. The NHS says a replacement knee will last for around 15 to 20 years if it is ""not put under too much strain,"" raising the prospect of the same people undergoing repeated surgery throughout their lives.

## Women Are Almost Twice as Likely as Men to Need Treatment

Of the 9,438 operations last year, almost 6,000 were for female patients. Women are almost twice as likely as men to need treatment. Tam Fry, from the National Obesity Forum, said: ""These figures will continue to rise.""

## The Human Body Has Evolved for Perfection

The human body has evolved for perfection and the knees and the legs and arms and all the bones fit together beautifully. What we have done over the last 50 years to an incredible degree is upset the balance of evolution.

## A Knee Replacement Is Classed as ""Major Surgery"" by the NHS

A knee replacement is classed as ""major surgery"" by the NHS and is only offered after other treatments, such as physiotherapy or steroid injections have failed to help. Last year one in 10 patients given new knees was obese, up from one in 20 just four years ago.

## The Department of Health Warned Obesity Affects All Age Groups

The Department of Health warned obesity affects all age groups and ""there is no magic bullet to solve the problem"". A spokesman said: ""It is going to take continued effort from all of us; Government, local communities, industry and individuals to reverse this trend.""

## Free Weight-Loss Surgery Could Be Offered to Nearly a Million Diabetes Patients

This month it was announced free weight-loss surgery could be offered to nearly a million diabetes patients. The health watchdog NICE called for more obese people with the condition to be considered for a gastric band or bypass. At a stroke, the ruling doubled to 1.8 million the numbers qualifying for taxpayer-funded surgery.

## Official Guidance Suggests Most Knee Operations Are Offered for Arthritis

Official guidance suggests that most knee operations are offered for arthritis, with the over-65s most likely need treatment. However, a quarter of those classed as obese who had knee operations were under 60. There has been a three-fold increase in knee replacements among the under-40s.

## In the Last Year Alone Nine People in Their Twenties and Seventy Thirty-Somethings Had Knee Operations

In the last year alone nine people in their twenties and seventy thirty-somethings had knee operations due to obesity. The NHS says a replacement knee will last for around 15 to 20 years if it is ""not put under too much strain,"" raising the prospect of the same people undergoing repeated surgery throughout their lives.

## Everyone Over the Age of 40 Can Have a Free NHS Health Check

Everyone over the age of 40 can have a free NHS health check to spot the warning signs of long-term illness- more people are taking them up than ever before. And for the first time we have given local authorities the power and over £5 billion in funding to tackle public health issues in their areas.","EXCLUSIVE: Almost 9,500 people classed as obese given  knee replacements .

The surgeon's transportation to the U.S. brings up questions as to what the Obama administration's policy is on paying for non-U.S. citizens' chartered flights back to America for treatment.

## The Situation in Sierra Leone

The situation in Sierra Leone is dire, with many people affected by Ebola and struggling to receive medical attention.

## The Role of Dr. Salia

Dr. Martin Salia will be flown from Sierra Leone to the United States where he will undergo treatment at the University of Nebraska Medical Center.

## Background about MEDEVAC Capabilities

The U.S. Department of State has denied allegations that they are trying to bring non-U.S. citizens to the country for Ebola treatment, stating that their primary goal is to evacuate their own citizens from West Africa using specially-equipped planes.

## Quotes from Experts and Officials

""Just the simple act of transporting somebody from West Africa to the United States, the person's got to be medically stable enough as well,"" said Dr. Sanjay Gupta, a CNN Medical Correspondent.

""There are absolutely no plans to MEDEVAC non-Americans who become ill from West Africa to the United States,"" stated an official at the U.S. Department of State.

## Background about Ebola Outbreak

The Ebola outbreak in West Africa has resulted in over 5,000 deaths and thousands more infected with the virus.

## The Current Situation in the U.S.

There are currently no Ebola patients being treated in the United States after Dr. Craig Spencer, a doctor with Doctors Without Borders, was released from Bellevue Hospital on Tuesday after testing negative for Ebola.

## Quotes from Politicians

""This is simply a matter of common sense that if you are concerned about this problem spreading … we certainly shouldn't be bringing in the patients,"" said Bob Goodlatte, House Judiciary Committee Chairman.

""We have discussed allowing other countries to use our MEDEVAC capabilities to evacuate their own citizens to their home countries or third-countries, subject to reimbursement and availability. But we are not contemplating bringing them back to the U.S. for treatment,"" stated an official at the U.S. Department of State.

## The Situation with Ebola Patients in the United States

Nurses Nina Pham and Amber Vinson contracted Ebola after treating a patient who had traveled from Liberia, but both nurses were subsequently cured after receiving treatment.

**PUBLISHED: 09:08 EST, 10 December 2013 | UPDATED: 16:51 EST, 10 December 2013**

Supermodel Elle Macpherson is accused of helping her billionaire husband conceal that he was flying a helicopter that crashed last year and took the life of his best friend.

**Ms Macpherson urged widow Daria Valdez to take the payout after husband Jeffrey Soffer, who also owns Miami's Fontainebleau Hotel, piloted the chopper into the ground Nov 22, 2012 in the Bahamas, the lawsuit says.**

Mr Soffer was at the helm despite not being licensed to fly. A licensed pilot was on board the aircraft but not at the controls, the suit alleges.

**The $100million wrongful death suit was filed Monday in Miami.**

As if nothing happened: Elle Macpherson and husband Jeff Soffer attend Perez Art Museum last week in Miami .

A copy of the lawsuit reviewed by MailOnline claims that Mr Soffer was at the controls when the helicopter crashed on Great Cauna Cay last year, taking the life of tax lawyer Lance Valdez.

‘Contrary to published newspaper reports, at the time of the helicopter crash, the helicopter was being piloted by Jeffrey Soffer,’ the suit claims. ‘Soffer was not licensed to fly,’ the suit continues. ‘[Nor was he a] sufficiently experienced helicopter pilot.’

The suit also accuses supermodel Elle Macpherson of taking part in the conspiracy by personally calling close friends for the purpose of having them convince the devastated widow to take the money.

'The Soffer induced...Elle Macpherson...to call Charles Holzer, another close friend of both Lance and Daria, and told him that Soffer was annoyed about Daria’s delay in signing the release, telling Holzer that ‘Soffer doesn’t have to do this you know,' the suit alleges.

Taking the millions in hush money meant signing a release relieving Mr Soffer of all liability stemming from the crash, according to the suit.

Shattered: Dasha and Lance Valdez in a photo from 2008, the picture of happiness .

'They knew Daria was beset with grief…at the time that they inappropriately pressured her to sign a release they knew was based upon false information,' the suit said. 'They took undue and improper advantage of her and the situation and circumstances surrounding the helicopter crash,' it continued.

Pilot David Pearce also signed a lawsuit guaranteeing him a six-figure salary with Mr Soffer's company in exchange for swearing he was piloting the helicopter at the time it crashed, according to the suit.

Mr Valdez, 48 and a father of three, was joined on the flight by a handful of other people but was the only one who did not survive the accident, according to the suit.

Daria Valdez, now a widow, claims in the suit she was handed $2million in insurance hush money to keep quiet about Mr Soffer piloting the chopper into the ground.

According to the bombshell lawsuit, co-defendants Daniel and Paula Riordan, as well as Alex Krys, were also on board the ill-fated flight and conspired with Mr Soffer and the pilot to conceal who was actually flying the chopper when her husband died.

‘The defendants] conspired and otherwise agreed to conceal… [that Mr Soffer] was flying the helicopter at the time of the crash,’ the suit says. ‘The purpose of this concealment and deception was, in turn, to induce [Mr Valdez’s widow] to accept $2million in insurance proceeds from insurance maintained on the helicopter… and to avoid liability for damages resulting from the wrongful death of Mr. Valdez.’

**He did not contact Mr Valdez’s widow until four days later, and also skipped his pal’s funeral.**

'Jeff Soffer is very sympathetic to Dasha and the children for their grave loss [and] denies all the allegations of wrongdoing,' his lawyer told the New York Post in a statement.

'Mr. Soffer has no further comments to make at this time since the lawsuit is now pending in federal court.'","The lawsuit claims billionaire Jeffrey Soffer piloted the helicopter into the ground despite not having a license to fly .

*   Passengers on board a research ship that has been trapped in Antarctic ice since Christmas Eve are expected to be rescued by helicopter tomorrow.
*   Three icebreakers failed to reach the paralysed vessel, but a helicopter on board a Chinese icebreaker, the Snow Dragon, aims to collect the 52 passengers trapped on the Russian ship MV Akademik Shokalskiy.
*   Ironically, the Akademik had gone in search of evidence of the world’s melting ice caps but instead the team of climate scientists had to abandon their mission because the ice is thicker than usual at this time of year.

**Rescue Operation**

The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) said the rescue would be a complex operation. Passengers on board Russian ship MV Akademik Shokalskiy that has been trapped in Antarctic ice since Christmas Eve are expected to be rescued by helicopter tomorrow.

*   A helicopter on board a Chinese icebreaker, the Snow Dragon, aims to collect the 52 passengers.
*   The 22 members of crew will remain on the stricken vessel.
*   This image, taken by passenger Andrew Peacock, shows the ship still stuck in the ice off East Antarctica, as it waits to be rescued.

**Background and Details**

The expedition, which set off from New Zealand on November 28, is being led by Chris Turney, a climate scientist, who was hoping to reach the base camp of Douglas Mawson, one of the most famous Antarctic explorers, and repeat observations done by him in 1912 to see what impact climate change had made.

*   Trapped: 74 people, including scientists, tourists, and a Guardian reporter, are stuck in thick ice sheets.
*   Crew members routinely check the hull of the ship, which gathers fresh layers of snow every night.
*   The looming helicopter rescue means the expedition will have to be cut short, Stone said.

**Current Situation**

Despite being stranded, those on board appear to be taking it all in stride. 'Surprisingly, all the passengers seem to be considering it the adventure of a lifetime,' Stone said.

*   Turney has also posted a photograph on Twitter apparently showing the Chinese vessel, a speck on the horizon beyond an expanse of ice.
*   ""Everyone well,"" Turney added.
*   He said trying to break through ice that was too thick would be 'like driving your car into a brick wall'.

**Update and Status**

The researchers on board have managed to get messages out saying they are well-stocked and continuing their research despite being trapped in five metres of ice sheets 1,500 miles south of Tasmanian capital Hobart.

*   Failed: This picture, tweeted by passenger Chris Turney, shows the top-of-the-range icebreaker, China's 'Snow Dragon' which also got stuck and was forced to retreat on Friday.

*   The ship had been on a multi-day tour from New Zealand to visit several sites along the edge of Antarctica before getting trapped in sea ice.
*   On board are scientists from the University of New South Wales, a journalist from The Guardian, and dozens of tourists who have paid to be part of the recreation of Mawson’s expedition.","MV Akademik Schokalskiy is stuck in thick ice sheet .

0f073fc393f3423e9c04feb8e33af2f874bd2e02,"# A College Football Star Has Been Accused of Brutally Beating a 66-Year-Old Man

Beau Smith, a 22-year-old wide receiver for Williamette University, appeared in Marion County Circuit Court in Oregon on Thursday, accused of murdering Michael Hampshire, a 66-year-old retired airplane mechanic.

## The Victim and the Suspect

Michael Hampshire was found dead from blunt-force trauma at an intersection just two blocks from his home at 3:42 AM on Wednesday. Pastor Dallas Yetter said Hampshire often took walks in the night when he had trouble sleeping and believed the man fell victim to a random attack.

Beau Smith, who is from California, appeared in court, charged with murder. A passerby found Hampshire's body, while a man covered in blood - believed to be Smith - waved down a patrolman a few blocks away, claiming he was in a fight.

## The Investigation

Marion County District Attorney Doug Hanson said officials are still investigating what happened but have no reason to believe the two men knew each other. Hampshire's neighbors said they don't recognize Smith, and a university spokesperson said Hampshire had no affiliation with Williamette University.

The university released a statement saying they are cooperating fully with the investigation and have started their own student conduct investigation. They would not say whether Smith is still considered an enrolled student.

## Smith's Background

Smith's attorney said he may enter a plea when he next appears in court, on December 11. He has been denied bail, in accordance with Oregon law. Before the next appearance, his attorney is working on providing evidence to the state that Smith is a strong student and athlete, as well as character references.

The student was in the top five per cent of his high school graduating class in Roseville and had a 4.0-plus grade point average. He then moved to Oregon to attend Williamette, where he played for the Bearcats - first as free safety and tight end before playing as wide receiver.

## Hampshire's Memory

Hampshire was remembered as a friendly neighbor who volunteered at a food share and enjoyed working on remodeling projects at his home. He lived alone with his dog after he and his wife separated a few years ago, his pastor told the Stateman Journal.

""He would catch me out in the yard working and just come over and talk,"" Yetter said. ""He liked working with his hands. He was innovative and liked to try new things. He liked a challenge.""

## Investigation Continues

The university is also investigating Smith's conduct, while the Oregon Department of Corrections records show Hampshire had completed probation in 2013 for menacing. The medical examiner concluded that Hampshire died of blunt force injuries to the head.","Beau Smith, a wide receiver for Williamette University in Oregon, has been accused of killing Michael Hampshire, a volunteer and retired mechanic .

Chloe Valentine was just four when she died of massive head injuries. Authorities considered Chloe Valentine to be 'at risk' before she was even born, an inquest into the four-year-old's death has heard.

**Multiple Calls Made to Families SA About Chloe**

By the time she was six-weeks-old, Families SA had received multiple calls about Chloe, including one saying her mother had almost set fire to a mattress on the lounge room floor where the baby was sleeping. Tragically Chloe, from Adelaide, died in January 2012 from injuries sustained over a three-day period in the backyard of a home at Ingle Farm, in the city's northeast.

**Mother and Partner Jailed for Neglect**

Her mother, Ashlee Polkinghorne, 22, and her then-partner, Benjamin McPartland, 28, are in jail after pleading guilty to the manslaughter of Chloe through criminal neglect. Giving evidence on Wednesday, Salvation Army employee Katie Lawson said she was Polkinghorne's case worker in 2007 when mother and baby lived in Salvation Army supported accommodation.

**Salvation Army Worker Describes Concerns About Mother**

Ms Lawson said she was contacted by a worried friend of Polkinghorne's who said the then 16-year-old's first comments after Chloe's birth were that she was 'glad it was all over so she could get pissed again'. Ms Lawson also learned from Families SA it had received a notification relating to concerns about the then-pregnant Polkinghorne, leading it to consider the unborn child as being 'at risk'.

**Godmother Describes Years of Chronic Neglect**

The godmother of four-year-old girl, who was surrounded by drugs and squalor and forced to ride a 50kg motorbike despite repeatedly crashing it, gave up on reporting her chronic neglect to authorities in the months prior to the girl's death, the inquest heard.

**Chloe Forced to Ride Motorbike Despite Repeated Crashes**

Chloe's godmother, Krystal Lee Benyk, said she contacted Family SA's child abuse report line on multiple occasions with complaints about Chloe's living arrangements, but it seemed to make no difference as the young girl was never removed from her mother. Eventually Ms Benyk gave up reporting Chloe's neglect, despite believing she was being abused by Polkinghorne's partner in the months leading up to her death.

**Godmother Felt 'Faith in System' Had Been Lost**

'Four-and-a-half years of reporting did nothing,' Ms Benyk said. 'I felt like faith in the system had been lost.'

**Chloe Suffered 39 Different Injuries Before Death**

On Monday, counsel assisting the coroner, Naomi Kereru, gave an overview of the case at the start of the inquest into the death of Chloe in January 2012. 'The pain she must have endured in the last few hours of her short life is difficult to comprehend,' said Ms Kereru.

**Families SA Involved in Extensive Way**

She outlined the extensive involvement of Families SA, dating back to when Polkinghorne became pregnant at 15, and its responses to numerous neglect notifications from family, friends and other agencies. 'Miss Polkinghorne claimed she was a better mother when she took amphetamines, as she would pick up Chloe and feed her and change her nappy ... as opposed to when she was drunk, when she would prop Chloe's bottle up to her mouth and leave it there,' Ms Kereru said.

**Chloe Died of 39 Different Injuries**

Polkinghorne was reported as having told her crying daughter: 'shut up you bitch', and having her child in her arms when a partner punched Polkinghorne twice. When questioned about this, Polkinghorne said Chloe had not cried 'as she had got used to violent incidents'.

**Families SA Workers Often Found Living Conditions Acceptable**

Chloe died of 39 different injuries in 2012. She was often visited by Families SA workers, but usually on scheduled dates when they found Chloe's living conditions acceptable.

**Concerns Raised About Polkinghorne's Ability to Convincingly Lie**

A friend who contacted Families SA about her concerns, said: 'This is one that will slip through the cracks, Ms Polkinghorne can be a very convincing liar'. A conversation was also recorded with Polkinghorne which was passed on to Families SA.

**Police Found Chloe in Care of 15-Year-Old**

Police advised they found Chloe in the care of a 15-year-old who was drinking in a park on a cold night and on another occasion at a shopping centre, while Polkinghorne was in a nearby liquor shop.

**Belinda Valentine Calls for Change After Inquest**

Belinda Valentine told The Advertiser the inquest which started today should not turn into a 'witch hunt'. She said: 'We can't change what happened to Chloe but, as a society, we have to learn from the tragedy of her death to prevent more children being damaged.'

**Coroner to Hear Evidence From Numerous Witnesses**

The coroner will hear evidence from numerous witnesses, including those who notified Families SA and the organisation's workers.","Godmother of Chloe Valentine from Adelaide gave up reporting neglect by her parents .

Despite receiving 20 notifications from various agencies about Chloe's dreadful circumstances, including reports of rats in their home and human faeces on the bathroom wall, she was never removed from her mother's care. A coroner's inquest has heard evidence that Families SA had multiple interactions with Polkinghorne but often found her living conditions acceptable during scheduled visits.

## Melanie Simmonds, 31, from Farnborough, Hampshire, was on a cheap holiday with her boyfriend Jay Buckley in Kefalonia, Greece.

## Plaster casts were put on her legs in a Greek hospital soon after she crashed off a 60ft cliff on the quad bike.

### Miss Simmonds had suffered multiple breaks in both legs, a broken finger, and fractured nose in the accident, which happened in June 2010. Mr Buckley sustained only minor injuries.

The crash was not deemed anyone's fault but the couple were not covered for quad biking in their insurance.

## She explained: 'Taxis were so expensive, so I suggested we hire a quad bike to get back.'

### They were so cheap to hire for the day. We'd seen other people do it and they looked fine. We both strapped on our helmets.

#### Charges Dropped: Woman Arrested for Selling Newborn Daughter

A 24-year-old woman has been charged with attempting to sell her newborn baby girl to two different people for a total of $5,000.

**Elizabethtown Police Report**

Leeanna Brown was arrested on Tuesday after police were made aware of the crime by her cousin, Luonda Martin. Martin had custody of the baby girl and reported Brown for attempting to take her daughter back.

According to The News-Enterprise, Martin told police she was planning to adopt the baby but that Brown had changed her mind and decided to give the little girl to someone else.

**Background on Leeanna Brown**

Brown has a history of run-ins with the law, including convictions for check fraud and shoplifting. She was charged in July with nonpayment of fines and first-degree possession of a controlled substance.

It is alleged that Brown attempted to sell her baby twice, once to a woman who backed out of the deal, and then again to Martin, who was told she had to cover Brown's fines and court costs in order to take custody of the child.

**Children Taken into Emergency Custody**

Brown has two other daughters, a one-year-old and a two-year-old. The arrest citation reveals that the person with whom Brown tried to sell her baby also has temporary guardianship of the older children. Both sets of children were taken into emergency custody by Child Protective Services.

Police have since discovered that the one-year-old child had been in the care of another couple for at least seven months, further complicating the situation.

**Reaction from Police**

""It's bizarre,"" said Elizabethtown Police Officer Virgil Willoughby. ""You can't just arbitrarily make a decision 'I'm going to give this child to person A, B, or C' and take money in exchange for that.""

**Leeanna Brown Held on $15,000 Bond**

Brown is being held at the Hardin County Detention Center with a bond set at $15,000 cash. She has been charged with endangering the welfare of a minor, a Class A misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in prison.

**Investigation Ongoing**

The people involved are also facing individual criminal charges, according to police. An investigation is ongoing into these allegations.","Leeanna Brown was arrested Tuesday in Elizabethtown, Kentucky, and charged with child endangerment .

27a6b5d10771f756a1cdc7921d1d1def53a6cf7d,"# Sympathy towards Nico Rosberg is not the prevailing sentiment in Britain at the moment, but let’s at least try to see if there is another side to the coin.

## I refer to Rosberg crashing into Lewis Hamilton at last week’s Belgian Grand Prix, a crime that caused the German to be ‘disciplined’ by his Mercedes team on Friday.

### In fact, I do believe Rosberg was marginally to blame for the second-lap smash. He was behind Hamilton and had a responsibility not to force the issue. But, that point conceded, Hamilton could have left Rosberg more space and still emerged ahead. 

#### Hamilton fought to win the corner, rather than the race or the championship. He eschewed pragmatism for instant glory.

**VIDEO Scroll down to watch Rosberg respond to claims the Spa crash was deliberate**

## Sorry: Lewis Hamilton (right) said he and Nico Rosberg had 'both made mistakes' in his statement.

### Damage:  Hamilton (left) and Rosberg clashed on the second lap as the Brit retires from the race.

#### Debris flies: Part of Hamilton's car takes to the air after the clash during a controversial Belgian Grand Prix.

* Winging it: A piece of Hamilton's wing soars over German Rosberg's Mercedes after the high-speed collision.
* From the get go: Hamilton got off to the perfect start, overtaking pole position holder Rosberg at the beginning.

## So, just as his team-mate did, Rosberg resolved not to yield. They crashed.

### The stewards of the meeting took 10 seconds to dismiss the crash as a ‘racing incident’. Charlie Whiting, the race director, agreed that there was no case to be answered.

#### These things happen; blame can be argued over; there are grey areas. Certainly, no malice aforethought could be proved: Rosberg was more likely to be disadvantaged by such a crash given that a broken front wing was more probable than his sparring partner’s tyre puncturing.

## Ah, but did not Rosberg admit he crashed deliberately? There is a nuance here.

### I took Rosberg’s alleged comment to mean he did not squirm out of the way when Hamilton, rightly, did not give way: he thought, to hell with this, I’m not going to be bullied. He did not mean that he set out with the intention of destroying his old friend’s race.

#### The stewards’ decision not to act should have been the end of the matter. But, no, team boss Toto Wolff appeared on TV. I thought he was auditioning for RADA.

## A $10 million Rose Bay property has hit the market, capturing the magical properties of light and space in the style of the Spanish Revival.

### The stunning residence was designed by architect Alan Edgecliff Stafford in 1934, who worked closely with fellow architects in Los Angeles and Palm Beach in Florida during his career.

#### The magnificent property is anticipated to fetch close to $10 million at auction on November 10, and is evidently inspired by classic properties from the sun-bathed areas of LA.

Built in the **Spanish Mission** architectural style that Los Angeles is so well known for, the house has been listed by the medical entrepreneur Robert Gregg and his wife, Elaine.

### The Greggs bought the Tivoli Avenue residence in 1998 for $2.14 million from Anne Melkman, though the house was originally built for George Eckblade, managing director of Wrigley's Australia, and his wife, Helen.

#### The Spanish Mission style was influenced by traditional American Spanish homes, and enjoyed an architectural revival in America throughout the later 19th century, known as Mission Revival architecture.

Within Australia the movement was known as **Spanish Colonial Revival** architecture, or Inter-War Spanish Mission, and became popular in Victoria and NSW, especially between 1925 and 1939.

Bondi, Manly, Elizabeth Bay, Bellevue Hill, Biscaya, and Rose Bay feature many Spanish Mission style houses built by Australian architects who were convinced that Mediterranean styles would suit the country's lifestyle.

Sydney's semi-Mediterranean climate made it an epicentre for the lavish Spanish Mission homes, including this Tivoli Avenue residence.

### The two-storey residence opens to an elegant entrance hall leads to a large formal sitting room.

#### The large 14-person dining room lends itself to both formal and casual dining, with a 1000-bottle bespoke wine cellar downstairs.

The state-of-the-art gas kitchen is perfect for catering for formal occasions or large family dinners.

Stafford bridged the two styles, operating between Australia and the US, evident in the design of the property which meshes Hollywood glamour with iconic Harbour views.

Original touches of the Spanish Mission style include **vaulted ceilings**, arched windows, juliet balconies, and a Spanish terra cotta tiled roof.

Much like the original style often featured white or yellow cream finish over brick walls, the Rose Bay residence stuns with white washed stucco walls and a light wine coloured exterior which offsets the expanse of native greenery on the property.

Completely restored in 1999 by John Normyle, who won the 2001 Heritage Award for the project, the Greggs later added the pool and self-contained guest cabana.

The home has also been the location for fashion shoots, used by internationally lauded Australian jewellery designer Samantha Wills for a Moroccan-inspired collaboration launch with ModelCo.

### The main bedroom suite is both luxurious and expansive with matching dressing rooms for a couple.

Two more bedrooms also have ensuites, on the same level as a lush sitting room with stunning views.

All four bedrooms have ensuites, with a large marble bathroom, a powder room, and under floor heating for extra indulgence.

fe2ed882067645ab73c4b5561b2856bd59094c6b,"# Britain's Horniest Student Revealed

## A Computer Science Student Boasts of Sleeping with Up to Three Men Every Week

Elina Desaine, a 20-year-old student at the University of Exeter, has been named Britain's horniest student after entering a degrading online competition. Despite her boasts, Elina doesn't even know the names of all her sexual partners, relying on handwritten descriptions like 'French guy' and 'third year' to recall her trysts.

## £500 and Condoms for Winning the Competition

Elina received £500 and a year's supply of condoms after winning the competition run by the controversial website Shagatuni.com. The website encourages 'no strings attached fun,' but its creator, Tom Thurlow, admits that Elina was an especially wild choice.

## ""Shag List"": A Record of Sexual Partners

Elina keeps a list of her sexual partners or, in her words, 'conquests.' However, she struggles to remember all their names and often resorts to descriptions like ""?"" instead of actual names. The student's ultimate goal is to seduce a lecturer, and one of her proudest moments was having sex in a university computer room.

## ""Modern-Day Feminist"" with a Reputation for Having Fun

The self-proclaimed 'modern-day feminist' entered the competition after being encouraged by a friend who said she had a 'reputation for having fun.' Elina hopes that future employers will see her actions as a bit of fun and not be deterred from hiring her.

## ""I'm Just Having Fun"": The Student's Attitude

Despite being begged by her housemates to take tests for sexually transmitted illnesses, the student claims she is 'just having fun.' Her friends are worried about what future employers might say, but Elina hopes they will see it as a bit of fun and that it shows she is more confident than the average girl.

## The Competition's Creator Defends the Winner

The website's creator, Tom Thurlow, defends Elina as the most sexually confident person he's ever met. He loves the fact that she uses her position in the computer science club to have sex in the computer room and even told him how the computer science club is perfect because it's full of guys.

## Sexual Health Experts Slam the Competition

Sexual health experts, however, condemned the competition as 'dangerous.' They believe it could encourage the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. Dr Peter Greenhouse said that most people who have sexual infections have no symptoms and get them from people who don't know they have it.

## The University's Response

The University of Exeter told Mail Online that they certainly don't condone this sort of behavior, but their main concern at this time is for the student and the impact this may have on her over the long term. They also pointed out that their regulations relating to the use of technology facilities state that personal or recreational use may be subject to temporary or permanent suspension.

## Elina's Rule: Using a Condom Every Time

Elina insists that her only rule is to only have sex when using a condom, and claims a recent chlamydia test returned a negative result. She believes this allows her to have fun without getting any diseases.","Elina Desaine does not know how many people she has had sex with .

Australia 108 is expected to be so extravagant that residents may have no desire to take another holiday again, as the $1 billion complex has everything you can think of to make life pretty sweet. Set to be not only Australia's highest building but also the tallest residential complex in the southern hemisphere, it is no surprise that the 1105-apartment building has attracted unprecedented interest from potential buyers.

The luxurious list of amenities boasts:
- Three community facilities
- Three pools
- Three gyms
- Three community lounges
- Six private dining rooms
- Private theatrettes
- Outdoor and indoor aviaries
- A golf simulator

Bursting through the clouds is a 797.4 square-metre penthouse on the 100th top floor fetching $25 million. The incredible view from one of the pools and gym above of Melbourne's city skyline is breathtaking.

One of six private dining rooms within one of three community facilities in the luxurious complex.

The exclusive Star Club enclave devoted to 'health, wellbeing, and entertaining' is contained on level 70, or 210 metres from the ground, in what is described as a 'two-storey starburst.' The majority of the 3000 square metres of communal space is divided into two realms to provide premium owners with privacy. Here will sit what is said to be 'Australia's two highest swimming spots' with infinity pools set against floor-to-ceiling glass to give swimmers a view of either the glittering city skyline or shimmering bay.

> 'There will be not a more spectacular place to take a dip than in Australia 108,' CBRE residential projects managing director Andrew Leoncelli said. 'Not for the faint of heart, these pools offer breathtaking views 210 metres above ground.'

The club's facilities also extend to dual gymnasiums, private theatrettes, bars, club lounges, and private dining areas in which to entertain friends and family.

94d72f5507205b337f4ea3b54751811fc5206b82,"# On paper it looks like the holy trinity of an attacking midfield,
## But Louis van Gaal's decision to play Adnan Januzaj and Angel di Maria either side of Juan Mata on Monday night may not be one he makes again.

Despite 90 minutes of nail-biting action, the first 30 minutes were most telling, and set the tone for the remainder of the game while summing up Manchester United's season so far. West Bromwich Albion dominated United for the opening period, leading the game at the half-hour mark and leading every physical battle to boot.

### Angel di Maria started on the left wing for Manchester United,
## Providing the assist for Marouane Fellaini.

Di Maria caused problems on the left, and often moved infield to penetrate West Brom's defence. Part of the problem was the load on midfielder Daley Blind as United attempted to spring forward using the three-pronged attacking midfield of Januzaj, Mata and Di Maria.

### Januzaj, starting his first game under Van Gaal,
## And not known for his defensive capabilities, was cemented to the right wing for the first-half,

Moving slightly inward in the second-half as United improved ever so slightly. Mata, playing in the absence of the suspended Wayne Rooney, saw very little of the ball throughout, and was bypassed by United's deeper midfielders and defence.

### Juan Mata started in the middle of the three-pronged attacking midfield at the Hawthorns.
## Mata spent much of the first-half helping Adnan Januzaj on the right of midfield,

And struggled to impact. On the opposite wing Di Maria was not an individual problem. In fact the Argentine was superb again, providing the assist for Marouane Fellaini's equaliser and delivering several dangerous balls having found himself in space.

### He did exactly what Januzaj didn't when 'stuck out' on the wing -
## Making use of the situation to full effect - with the Belgian picking up a 5.5/10 rating bySportsmail.

Di Maria at least attempted to move in and penetrate the penalty area more than once, as shown in his heat map. Mata, meanwhile, is an ongoing dilemma - a £37.5million midfielder without a defined place in Van Gaal's system to justify the price tag - and it showed again at the Hawthorns.

### Januzaj, on his first start for United under Van Gaal,
## Hardly had an effect on the game on the right wing.

The Belgian hugged the right wing for United, and his delivery into the box was often poor. The only man directly between Mata and goal, striker Robin van Persie, was given no support by the Spaniard and nothing to feed off. The two played too far apart, forcing (or enabling, Van Gaal would argue) United to use the flanks even more.

### Too wide and not clinical enough,
## United were stretched.

Space behind the striker that Rooney would often fill was vacant, meaning United struggled to win the ball high up the pitch. Albion's only roadblock to goal when winning the ball in midfield was an out-of-position Ander Herrera and an exposed Blind.

### The Januzaj-Mata-Di Maria trio made just one tackle between them,
## Compared to five by West Brom's attacking midfield three of Chris Brunt, Stephane Sessegnon and Graham Dorrans.

It was no surprise both goals came on the break with the  trio chasing shadows, and the second goal in particular cut through the heart of United, as can be seen below. MORE HEAT MAPS AND STATS FROM SPORTSMAIL'S MATCH ZONE SERVICE HERE

### West Brom's second goal, scored by Saido Berahino (18) came from United being cut right down the middle.
## Fellaini was brought on for the second half and had a big impact on the match,

Scoring the equaliser. Van Persie was often playing off the last West Brom man, but Mata struggled to connect with him. Van Gaal got his tactics wrong at 8pm, but the game quickly changed complexion after the first-half.

### As is not often the case,
## There weren't too many question marks over Fellaini's introduction at the expense of Herrera at half-time,

Giving Blind more physical support. It worked in an attacking sense, too. United finally had some control going forward, but none when tracking back. Two goals each was a rather predictable scoreline.

### Berahino celebrates putting West Brom ahead in the second half at the Hawthorns.
## Louis van Gaal's side looked better attacking than defending,

And not for the first time this season.","Louis van Gaal played Adnan Januzaj to the right and Angel di Maria to the left of Juan Mata in the 2-2 draw at the Hawthorns .
Di Maria was superb with his delivery and utilised the wing, but both Januzaj and Mata failed to have an impact .

Mata struggled to impact the game, while Di Maria excelled on the left wing but was isolated on the flank. Januzaj had little effect on the right wing and was often stuck in a position that limited his influence. The trio's inability to track back effectively led to goals for Albion, with the second goal cutting through United's midfield. However, Fellaini's introduction at halftime changed the complexion of the game, as United finally gained control going forward but continued to struggle defensively."

A devastating crash in Hesperia, California, has left a family of five dead after a delivery van driven by 30-year-old Joshua Smith ran into their car.

According to blood results released by the San Bernardino County Sheriff-Coroner Department, Smith was high on prescription drugs at the time of the crash and fell asleep behind the wheel. The investigation found that Smith had ""identifiable quantities of narcotics in his system"" when he crashed into the family's Honda sedan on May 11.

**The Victims**

The victims were identified as Angelica Garcia, 25; her father, Gerardo Jimenez; brothers Ivan, 2, and Freddie, 9; and daughter Cynthia, who would have turned five the following day. The family was on their way to Disneyland to celebrate both Mother's Day and Cynthia's birthday.

**The Crash**

Smith, who was doing a delivery of flowers for Mother's Day, swerved into the left-hand side lane and hit the Honda sedan carrying the family, who were stationary at a stop sign. He suffered only minor injuries.

**Aftermath**

Relatives confirmed that the family was on their way to Disneyland, which is about an hour and 20 minutes away in Anaheim. The full car was crushed by the van, and it wasn't until after the van was removed that the body of two-year-old Ivan was found.

A cross with five candles was erected at the site to remember the family that was lost. Tributes poured in from the community, with a man lighting candles by the cross.

**Investigation**

No arrests have been made, but the investigation is ongoing. Sheriff's Sgt. Doug Hubbard described the scene as ""very rare"" and said that all five members of the family died in a violent manner.

The collision occurred just before 7 a.m. at Main Street and Balsam Avenue in Hesperia. Investigators determined that the van was traveling eastbound on Main Street when it went into westbound lanes, collided with the Honda sedan, and landed on top of the car.","Crash occurred about 7am on May 11 in Hesperia, California .

By Laura Collins
The sister of the Indian diplomat accused of keeping her maid a ‘virtual slave’ has hit out against critics’ claims that her sibling is a ‘rich elite poster girl of privilege.’ 

Sharmistha Khobragade, 39, has revealed: ‘She is receiving hate mails from unknown random people accusing her of “using slave labor” and being a rich elite poster child of privilege.’

She said: ‘More than the public humiliation she has been through, these accusations which attack the very core of her value system are causing her deep pain and anguish.’ 

**The Accusations**

Sharmistha broke her silence in a lengthy Facebook posting in which she rebutted the allegations made by Dr Khobragade’s maid, Sangeeta Richard.

She hit back at the presentation of her sister as ‘a rich elite poster child of privilege, used to having servants at her beck and call, an exploiter and a hypocrite for talking about women’s rights.’

**Devyani's Background**

Dr Khobragade’s background is certainly one of considerable comfort and academic ambition.

Born and brought up in Mumbai, her father, Uttam is former magistrate and retired IAS officer and her uncle, Dr Ajay M Gondane is Indian High Commissioner to Papua New Guinea.

She studied medicine and qualified from the Seth GS Medical College and King Edward Memorial Hospital in Mumbai but abandoned it to enter the Indian Foreign Service in 1999.

**Devyani's Dalit Heritage**

But it was neither family precedent nor her own undoubted abilities that secured Dr Khobragade her place in the IFS. Instead, it was the fact that she is a Dalit – or Untouchable – which allowed her entrance to the IFS on the India’s quota system for ‘Schedule Castes'.

A total of 7.5 per cent of all jobs in the IFS must go to members of Scheduled Castes. The system was established with the aim of helping social mobility.

**The Real Story**

According to Sharmistha, Richard was welcomed as a member of the family and forged a close bond with the girls for whom she largely cared.

In return, she left ‘without any warning or notice,’ she said, and ‘without even leaving a good-bye not for the girls who were so fond of her.’

Sharmistha claimed that Dr Khobragade offered to pay for Richard’s flight back to India if she was unhappy with her role and that when ‘she faced Devyani across a negotiating table,’ Richard told her: ‘I will not go back. Why will I go back? I know that if I go back I will never be able to come back to the US.’

**The Family's Reaction**

Dr Khobragade’s brother, Shashank, posted his own comment describing the ‘US behaviour as arrogant and inhuman.’

Speaking to MailOnline Dr Khobragade’s father, Uttam, revealed that he planned to travel to New York to be with his daughter.

Describing the sequence of events as ‘shocking’ he said: ‘She’s a brave girl. She has not done anything wrong. I myself was a magistrate for seven years. She has not done anything that warrants her arrest.’

And though Sharmistha spoke of her sister’s sense of personal betrayal, her father insisted: ‘The whole of India feels that it is not an attack on Devyani, it is an attack on Indian sovereignty.’

##A teenager's harrowing experience highlights the risks of catching tuberculosis (TB) from pets.
Jessica Livings, 19, contracted TB while cleaning her pet cat Onyx's open wound, making her one of the first cases in the world.

###Symptoms and Treatment
She suffered pneumonia, emergency surgery, and severe lung damage. Her mother Claire also caught a dormant form of the disease. Another victim who caught TB from a pet dog eventually recovered, but their dog was put down.

####Jessica's Account
""I lost a stone and half in five weeks, I was very ill and had fevers, cold sweats, and hallucinations,"" she said. ""I didn't realize what was real and what wasn't.""

###Cause of Infection
The kittens are believed to have picked up the disease from badgers.

####Screening and Antibiotics
Thirty-nine people who may have been in contact with infected cats were offered screening for TB. Jessica is now on a nine-month course of antibiotics and considered at no risk of passing on TB.

###Investigation and Outcomes
Seven out of nine infected cats had bite wounds thought to have come from fights with badgers. Six have been put down or have died, including Onyx and Jasper. An 18-month-old tabby named Milhouse has vanished.

####Vet's Perspective
Carl Gorman, the vet who reported the outbreak, believes it started with a local herd of cows contracting TB. He is treating two surviving cats despite guidelines to euthanize them.

###Public Health Response
Public Health England confirmed two patients infected by the TB bacteria Mycobacterium bovis were undergoing treatment. Two others have been diagnosed with latent TB, meaning they are not showing symptoms.

####Government's Efforts
The British farming industry slaughters 30,000 cows with TB each year. The Government is undertaking a cull to try to combat the problem of badgers spreading the disease.

###Rarity and Precautions
It is rare for cats to contract TB, with about 25 cases each year in Britain. The nine infected cats all lived within three miles of each other – and six within a 250-yard radius.

####Pet Owner's Account
Another pet owner, Julie Foster, told of her anguish after her cat contracted tuberculosis and had to be put down. She said they had no idea it could be the disease when Mocha developed a painful lump on his paw.","Jessica Livings, 19, caught TB from her pet kitten Onyx .
She is thought to be the first case of cat-to-human transmission .
Had to be rushed to hospital for surgery on severely damaged lungs .
She was feverish, hallucinating and lost a stone and a half in five weeks .
Experts think she became infected while cleaning pet's open wound .
Onyx was one of nine cats in Home Counties thought to be infected .
Seven of the animals had bite marks believed to be from badgers .
News emerged as child caught TB from her dog, which had to be destroyed .","A 19-year-old woman and her mother contracted tuberculosis (TB) from their pet kitten, Onyx, which had likely caught the disease from badgers. The woman, Jessica Livings, suffered severe lung damage and required emergency surgery, while her mother contracted a dormant form of the disease. Two other people in England have also been diagnosed with TB after coming into contact with infected cats. The outbreak has raised concerns about the spread of the disease among domestic animals, with nine cats known to be infected in the Newbury area of Berkshire. Public Health England is offering screening for 39 people who may have been exposed to the infected cats. The cases highlight the need for owners to take precautions when handling pets that may have come into contact with badgers or other animals carrying TB."

The public sector's wasteful spending on useless projects costs every British household £4,500 a year - enough to 'buy a luxury holiday for every family', according to the TaxPayers' Alliance.

## Identifying Cuts to Save £120 Billion

The organisation has identified cuts that it says could save about £120 billion – effectively wiping out the UK's budget deficit – without 'closing a single hospital, firing a single teacher or disbanding a single regiment'.

### Ludicrous Examples of Wasteful Spending

* The Ministry of Defence paid £22 for a light bulb
* The Arts Council squandered £95,000 on an installation comprising a skip covered in yellow lights
* Cotswold District Council spent £19,000 hiring a 'motivational magician' to boost staff morale
* Labour-run Durham Council gave chiefs a £12,000 clothing allowance

## Wasteful Spending Breakdown

* The alleged wasteful spending - a sixth of the total government expenditure - is more than the whole of the NHS budget and five times the amount spent by the Ministry of Defence.
* This equates to a massive £4,500 for every household in the UK - enough to give every family in the land a luxury holiday or pay their household energy bills three times over.

## Recommendations for Major Reforms

The TaxPayers' Alliance recommends a number of major reforms to claw back cash, including shaving £53 billion off the pay and pensions packages of public sector workers.

### Major Examples of Wasteful Spending

* Cheshire East Council spent £30,000 building two ponds for 18 newts which had been displaced by the construction of a bypass
* Arts Council paid £2.5 million to decorate the side of inter-continental trucks to promote Lincolnshire Fenlands in Europe
* The Government biscuit bill in 2011-2012 was £3 million
* Ministry of Justice spent £4.5 million to taxi firms for moving prisoners and staff around the country

## TaxPayers' Alliance Suggestions

The TaxPayers' Alliance suggests:

* Scrapping the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and Department for Culture, Media and Sport and hiving off their essential functions to other departments
* There could be far fewer locum doctors now that GPs work out-of hours far less frequently than they used to

## Response from Cabinet Office

A spokesman for the Cabinet Office insisted that work was well under way to make government 'leaner'. He added: 'This Government has accelerated its work tackling waste and the Cabinet Office recently announced achieved savings of £10 billion over 2012-13.'","Costs include £19,000 spent by council on hiring ‘motivational magician’

More than £20 billion is lost through public sector fraud and £15 billion on duplicated procurement across Whitehall departments and councils.
The Home Office spent £427,000 on rubber bullets police are not even allowed tom use.
Crawley Council Spent £5,070 on 12,200 hot drinks from vending machines for employees, when the equivalent number of tea bags would have cost just £200.","A pressure group, the TaxPayers' Alliance, has identified £120 billion of wasteful spending by the public sector, which could be cut without harming frontline services. The alleged waste includes £19,000 spent on a ""motivational magician"" and £95,000 on an installation featuring a skip covered in yellow lights. This waste is estimated to cost every British household £4,500 per year. The group recommends reforms such as reducing pay and pensions packages for public sector workers by £53 billion and cutting the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills and Culture, Media and Sport budget.

It is the type of vegetable a person eats, not gorging on large quantities that helps beat obesity, a new study has found. **Eating as little as one or two fist-sized portions of leafy green and orange vegetables has been found to 'significantly' reduce an overweight child's risk of suffering obesity-related diseases**, including type 2 diabetes, liver and heart disease.

Regardless of whether the youngsters taking part in the study lost weight, selecting the right vegetables to eat is a critical part of the puzzle, scientists discovered. The team of researchers at the universities of Texas and Southern California found that boosting levels of spinach and broccoli, as well as carrots, in a child's diet reduced the level of 'bad fats' in the body.

**A new study has found that eating one or two fist-sized portions of carrots or leafy green vegetables a day can reduce the chance of overweight and obese children suffering type 2 diabetes**, liver disease and other obesity-related diseases. And the findings revealed the insulin levels of the overweight Latino children taking part also improved.

Children who regularly ate one or two fist-size portions of the non-starchy vegetables reduced their risk of liver problems, type 2 diabetes and other obesity-related illnesses. While the children, who ranged in age from eight to 18, still failed to eat the recommended daily allowance of nutritious vegetables, as stipulated by the US Department of Agriculture, the scientists noted the improvements to their health were significant.

**Jaimie Davis, assistant professor at the University of Texas, said:** 'For a lot of at-risk children, intake of vegetables is really low. We found, though, even eating less than a full serving of these vegetables can really have a pronounced effect on children's health. One large leafy green salad as a regular part of lunch is enough to make a difference.'

The study noted fewer than six per cent of children in the US eat the USDA-recommended multiple servings of nutrient-rich vegetables most days.

**Researchers examined the effects of nutrient-rich vegetables in the diets of 175 overweight or obese children in Los Angeles.**

The research, by a team at the universities of Texas and Southern California, found children who ate carrots, broccoli and spinach were at a reduced risk of suffering a raft of health problems linked to their weight.

**The study found the leafy green and orange, non-starchy vegetables lowered levels of bad fat in the body and helped regulate insulin levels.**

They found very small differences - equating to a quarter of a cup or around 30g per day, could be linked to improvements insulin levels and a reduction in bad fats in the body.

**Visceral fat is deemed 'bad fat' because it lingers around internal organs and masses in the liver.**

Some types of body fats are more dangerous because they can cause serious health complications, sending the wrong signals to the brain about when and how much to eat.

The scientists emphasised it is the type of vegetable that matters, adding that starchier vegetables such as corn and potatoes did not reap the same positive effects of leafy greens and orange-coloured options.

**The study was published in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics reports.**","Study at the universities of Texas and Southern California found it is type of vegetable not the quantity that makes a difference to health .

## But in a week the solar system will put on a light show of its own, when a comet passes close to Earth’s orbit.

In fact, comet Lovejoy will come so close that it will be visible to the naked eye - but you'll want to get a look at it soon, as it won’t return again for 8,000 years. Scroll down for video .

## People in the UK and elsewhere in the Northern Hemisphere will be treated to a cosmic light show early in the new year.

On 7 January 2015 comet C/2014 Q2 (Lovejoy), pictured by astronomer Dieter Willasch on 28 Dec, will make its closest approach to Earth. It will be visible to observers on Earth near the constellation of Orion .

## The comet, formally designated C/2014 Q2 (Lovejoy), was discovered by amateur astronomer Terry Lovejoy from Queensland, Australia.

On 7 January 2015 it will make its closest approach to Earth at a distance of 43.6 million miles (70.2 million km) - although it is already visible in the night sky. It will make its closest approach to the sun on 30 January at a distance of 1.29 AU (one astronomical unit - AU - is the distance from Earth to the sun) before heading back out of the solar system.

## The remarkable comet will pass near the constellation of Orion according to Slate's Phil Plait, which should make it fairly easy to spot in the night sky.

It will then make its way past the Taurus and the Pleiades constellations. The comet's position in the sky can be tracked on various websites such as Sky and Telescope.

## In photos of the comet taken so far it appears green, which is due to the way its molecules react to sunlight.

Astronomer Gem from a planet very far away... wait, I mean astronomer Gem doesn't actually appear. Astronomer Gem was just a placeholder I used for this example. To be honest, I don't know any astronomers named Gem. Astronomer Paul Stewart on the other hand does take photos of comets.

## This one, for instance, has an orbital period of 8,000 years - so it won’t return until about 10015 AD, if anyone is still around to see it.

Its orbit takes it out to a distance of about 90 billion kilometres (56 billion miles) - more than 20 times the distance of the sun to Neptune. Its orbital period was actually originally longer, about 11,500 years, but gravitational effects from the planets have shortened its orbit.

## The remarkable comet will pass near the constellation of Orion, seen here, which should make it fairly easy to spot in the night sky.

It will then make its way past the Taurus and the Pleiades constellations before beginning its journey back out of the solar system .

The comet is seen here in a picture by astronomer Graham Bowes. The comet appears green because its atoms and molecules are ionised and give off a specific wavelength of light - like a neon sign. In this instance with the comet, it is due to the molecules cyanogen and diatomic carbon, which both glow green .

## The comet was first discovered by Mr Lovejoy on 17 August this year.

Initially, it hadn’t been expected to get very bright but, as it approached the sun it began to brighten considerably as the sun melted its icy surface. And If the name ‘Comet Lovejoy’ rings a bell, that’s because Mr Lovejoy has discovered four similar comets before.

One of the most famous was Comet C/2011 W3 (Lovejoy), which made a close approach to Earth in 2011 and was observed by many observers - even astronauts on the ISS - above Earth. ISS Commander Dan Burbank captured spectacular imagery of 2011's comet C/2011 W3 (Lovejoy) from about 240 miles (384km) above Earth’s horizon on 21 December 2011.

*Trump says there's ""a very good chance"" president Obama pretended to be Kenyan in order to attract financial aid money in college.* *""Because if you say you were born in Kenya, you got aid, and you got into colleges,"" Trump said, ""People were doing that.""*

The Apprentice star told Washington-based reporters on Tuesday that he still doesn't understand why president Obama would turn down a $50 million gift to charity if he's telling the truth about his past. Donald Trump, chairman and president of the Trump Organization, said today it's possible that president Obama was born in the U.S. but lied on college applications and said he was from Kenya.

*""Because if you say you were born in Kenya, you got aid, and you got into colleges,"" Trump said.* 

Trump's disbelief that Obama is indeed an American citizen, as required by law to hold the presidency, stems from a typo in a book agency's 1991 biography of Barack Obama, in which Obama was listed as being from Kenya. After the bio surfaced in 2012 a former editor at the book company said it was 'a fact checking error.' Trump isn't as sure the line itself was a mistake as he is that then-Illinois state senator Barack Obama made a mistake in having it put in his promotional materials.

Even after Obama released documentation of his birth, Trump said he remained unconvinced. Several days before the 2012 presidential election, Trump announced that he was offering President Obama $5 million to put toward a charity in his home town, Chicago, Illinois, if he turned over his birth certificate, passport and college records.

Trump says he later increased that amount to $50 million, a number that was not reported in the media at the time, but Obama still wouldn't play ball. *""I never heard from him,"" Trump said on Tuesday, adding that he would take the money if it were the other way around.*

*'The Donald' got on the subject of Obama's background today after he was asked during the Q and A portion of a National Press Club luncheon if he regretted his past statements about the president's birthplace. *""Not even a little bit,"" Trump said.* *""I don't regret it.""*

*""Why would I regret it?""* he asked amid applause from the audience. Trump said there were three scenarios to explain Obama's past: *""Either it's fine, or he was born in Kenya, or in my opinion there's a... very good chance he was born here, and said he was born in Kenya.""*

*""Because if you were born in Kenya, you got into colleges, and you got... aid,"" Trump said.* *""Very simple.""* Though many Americans have tired of Trump's quest to see Obama's personal records, Trump claims people on the street are still asking him to pursue the issue.

*'Now I hope that it's 100 percent fine,' Trump said, but later mentioned 'I'd love to see what's put down.' Believe it or not, Donald Trump's hair is real.*

*""They attack my hair. It's mine,""* Trump said during his speech while yanking on his head.* *""Would anybody like to inspect?""* Unlike Obama, Trump says he's all facts and no fiction.

His hair? Totally real, Trump said on Tuesday. *""They attack my hair. It's mine,""* Trump said during his speech while yarking on his head.* *""Would anybody like to inspect?""*

*'They say you wear the worst hairpiece I've ever seen, what a horrible wig,'* he continued, explaining that he's made it clear on Twitter that his hair is real, yet people keep claiming it's fake for some reason he said.

*""You know it's funny, but when people wanna keep going, they keep going,""* Trump noted. The billionaire was less forthcoming about whether or not he has any big political plans for 2016.

*'We’re going to see what happens in ‘16,'* he said.* ' If I don’t see the... right person, I will do something in ’16.  I will do it sure as you’re... sitting here.'","Donald Trump still doesn't understand why president Obama wouldn't accept his offer to put $50 million toward a charity of the president's choice if he's telling the truth about his background .

Trump claims he offered Obama $50 million to charity if he provided his birth certificate and college records, but Obama refused. Trump still doesn't believe Obama is an American citizen due to a 1991 biography that listed him as being from Kenya, which was later attributed to a fact-checking error. He has proposed three scenarios for Obama's past: being fine, being born in Kenya, or being born in the US and claiming to be Kenyan to get aid and admission into college."
9cb3f59da40e0f8576af8fd6f6d2ebe05d9b1f29,"**The Collapse of Easter Island's Civilisation: New Discoveries Reveal What Allowed Ancient Inhabitants to Flourish**

The collapse of Easter Island's civilisation is often used as a cautionary tale to show the folly of humans who overexploit their surroundings, but scientists have now discovered what allowed the ancient inhabitants to flourish in the first place.

Tiny plant fossils preserved in the dental plaque on teeth found among human remains on the remote Pacific island have revealed that sweet potatoes were a staple food for the ancient Easter Islanders. The discovery was made by Miss Sarah Tromp and her colleague Dr John Dudgeon, who studied 30 human teeth from the remains of 26 individuals found at archaeological sites around the island.

**Sweet Potatoes Were Not Indigenous to Easter Island**

The researchers found that starch grains from modern sweet potatoes matched those found in the ancient dental plaque. This suggests that sweet potatoes were brought to Easter Island by the first Polynesian settlers, and were not indigenous to the island.

""We think this is evidence that they had the sweet potato with them when the Polynesian settlers colonised the Island,"" said Miss Tromp. ""It was not indigenous.""

The team also found microfossils from palm trees in a much larger quantity than starch grains, which does support that there was once a large quantity of palm trees on Easter Island in the past.

**Palm Trees Were Cleared to Make Room for Sweet Potato Crops**

The scientists found that microfossils from palm trees can become incorporated into the skins of sweet potatoes, suggesting that the vegetables were grown in soil that had been cleared of palm trees. This suggests that the palm trees may have been removed to make room for agricultural land for growing sweet potatoes.

Dr Dudgeon said that the team are now analysing DNA recovered from the dental plaque to see if they can identify animal proteins. They have also been able to recover some plant chloroplast DNA but have yet to match it to a species.

**New Theories About the Demise of Easter Island's Civilisation**

The discovery may lead to new theories about what led to the demise of the civilisation on Easter Island. Dr Dudgeon said that the normal and sustained use of palm trees, coupled with the loss of germinative seeds or nuts from Polynesian rat predation, is more likely to have caused the extinction of the island's native palm tree.

""Forest clearance activities may have had some effect on the sheer number of trees on the island, but I am not convinced that agricultural activities are the prime cause of forest extirpation on Rapa Nui,"" said Dr Dudgeon.

**The Collapse of Easter Island's Civilisation**

By the time the first European explorers discovered the island in 1722, the population had dropped from around 15,000 to between 2,000 and 3,000 and the land was almost barren. Starvation and war over the remaining resources are thought to have devastated the once stable civilisation and led to some of the famous stone heads being toppled.

Easter Island now boasts a population of around 5,000 but by the time the second expedition of European explorers arrived at the island in 1877, its population had almost completely died out. Disease and slave raiding during the 19th century further reduced the population of the island to just over 100 by 1877.

**Conclusion**

The discovery that sweet potatoes were a staple food for the ancient Easter Islanders is a significant one, and may lead to new theories about what led to the demise of their civilisation. The collapse of Easter Island's civilisation remains a cautionary tale about the impact of human activity on the environment, but now we have a better understanding of how these ancient inhabitants managed to flourish in such a marginal island.","Sweet potato was main source of food and water on island scientist find .
Vegetable dominated the islander's diet for hundreds of years before European explorers first arrived on Easter Island in 18th Century .
Palm tree fossils also found in tooth plaque may have come from tree fragments embedded in the skins of sweet potatos grown in the same soil .
Findings suggest that palm tree forests were cut down to make room for agricultural land to grow sweet potatoes, leading to extensive soil erosion .
Scientists hope their findings will help explain the mystery of what led to the downfall of the doomed civilisation that lived on Easter Island .","Scientists have discovered what allowed the ancient inhabitants of Easter Island to flourish before their civilization's collapse. Microfossils preserved in dental plaque on teeth found among human remains revealed a diet dominated by sweet potatoes, which were brought to the island by Polynesian settlers around 1200 AD. The starch grains from sweet potatoes were found embedded in the hardened plaque of ancient human teeth, suggesting that they formed a major part of the islanders' diet. This finding suggests that the introduction of pests like Pacific rats and the destruction of palm forests may have contributed to the demise of the civilization, rather than just agriculture for sweet potatoes. The research, published in the Journal of Archaeological Science, provides new insights into the history of Easter Island and its people."

*Anthony Peloe, 43, who was serving an indeterminate sentence for possessing firearms with intent to cause harm, and convicted robber John Arnold, 30, absconded from Thorn Cross open prison.*

Prison officials at the jail in Warrington, Cheshire, discovered that the two inmates had failed to return on Saturday evening.

**The escapees**

*John Arnold was serving an indeterminate sentence for robbery and assault.*
*Anthony Peloe was serving a life sentence for possessing firearms with intent to cause harm.*

Both men were allowed out of prison as part of their rehabilitation program but failed to return on time.

**A pattern of escapes?**

This is not the first time that prisoners have escaped from Cheshire prisons. In recent months, two other inmates, Arnold Pickering and Thomas Moffett, also absconded from HMP Kennet in Maghull, Merseyside.

*Arnold Pickering was serving 18 years for murder.*
*Thomas Moffett was serving seven years for robbery.*

Their escapes have been widely criticized by the public and politicians alike.

**The review**

An urgent review is currently taking place into why the escapees were allowed temporary day release earlier this month.

**A history of escapes**

In recent months, several other prisoners have escaped from open prisons in the UK. These include:

*Michael Wheatley, who went on the run for four days after absconding from Standford Hill open prison in Kent.*
*Ian McLoughlin, who was convicted of murdering Graham Buck while on day release.*

The review has been sparked by widespread criticism of the prison system and concerns over public safety.

**Government response**

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said: ""Keeping the public safe is our priority and I will not allow the actions of a small minority of offenders to undermine public confidence in the prison system.""

He announced immediate changes to tighten up the system, including:

*No longer transferring prisoners to open conditions or allowing them out on temporary release if they have previously absconded.*
*No unrestricted ""town leave"" for prisoners.*

The measures are aimed at preventing future escapes and ensuring that the public is safe from unreformed, dangerous criminals.","Anthony Peloe had been in jail for possessing firearms with intent to harm .
He and robber John Arnold absconded from Thorn Cross in Warrington .
Prison officials discovered the pair were missing at 10.30am yesterday .

This incident comes as part of a wider concern over prisoner safety, with recent cases highlighting the risks posed by allowing hardened criminals out on temporary release.

003cd8cef9761b4114a57bc60caf6c9b808d6742,"# Manchester City Remain an Enigma to Me

On Sunday they face their main rivals for the title in Chelsea and they have been transformed as a club since Sheik Mansour took them over in 2008.

## The Owners' Investment

That said, the owners have invested £865 million in the club in the six years in which they have owned it yet I still can’t quite grasp their true identity.

### On Their Day, They Can Be Something Special

On their day, they can be something special. Look at their results against Manchester United in the past three seasons. In six Premier League games they have scored 18 goals against them and won five of those games. And in the majority of those encounters they have been absolutely brilliant.

#### Vincent Kompany Picks Up Yaya Toure

Vincent Kompany picks up Yaya Toure after German champions Bayern Munich's late winner on Wednesday evening, as City left-back Gael Clichy fails to stop Arjen Robben passing him at the byline.

## They Have Also Shown Weaknesses This Season

Man City can dazzle, but they have also showed their weaknesses this season, losing to Stoke at home. The pace of their game, the way they have moved the ball, the speed of their attacks and their strength at the back have been too much for United.

### A Different Level

They are on a completely different level and those performances have been close to 10/10 displays. On days like that you’re left wondering whether they can challenge Real Madrid and Barcelona.

## Too Many 'Sleepy' Players

But I don’t see them hitting those heights nearly enough. If you catch City on an off day you can definitely take points off them, as Stoke did the other week. And there are far too many of those days for a club of their aspirations.

### The Great Premier League Teams

When I think about the great Premier League teams such as Manchester United and Arsenal in the 1990s and 2000s, players like Patrick Vieira, Emmanuel Petit, Thierry Henry, Dennis Bergkamp, Roy Keane, Paul Scholes and Cristiano Ronaldo would put in performances that were 8/10 every single week.

## A Team Without Identity

And if you happened to catch them on a good day, they could reach the heights of greatness. But I'm not convinced Man City have found their true identity yet. 

### Costa's Hat-trick Against Swansea

I would put his former Atletico team-mate, Radamel Falcao, just ahead of him overall but he still looks like the missing link for Chelsea.

## Fabregas and Courtois Adapt Quickly

Together with Cesc Fabregas, he has formed a wonderful understanding and Chelsea look a better side than last season — and that’s after having made a profit of transfers in the summer. 

### A Wonderful Understanding

Fabregas looks to be the perfect replacement for Frank Lampard. He might not score as many but he will create more.

## The Players Deserve Time to Recover

You might have thought it would take Chelsea three or four months for their new signings to settle in but Costa, Fabregas and Thibaut Courtois have adapted straight away, which is why I have them as title favourites.","Manchester City face their main rivals for the title in Chelsea on Sunday .
City often dazzle with their performances and can be truly special .
But they don't hit the heights nearly enough, and on an off-day they can be easily beaten, as Stoke proved last month by winning at the Etihad .
They must not fall into the trap of 'one season on and one season off'
Currently, Jose Mourinho's Chelsea look a better outfit .
Diego Costa is the real deal and is tailor-made for English football .
Yaya Toure deserves time to refresh himself and regain form .","Manchester City face Chelsea on Sunday, seeking to close the five-point gap behind their title rivals. Despite investing £865m since 2008, City's identity remains unclear, with inconsistent performances and a lack of consistency from key players aside from Sergio Aguero and Vincent Kompany. While they can be brilliant on their day, as seen in victories over Manchester United, their weaknesses are exposed when they have off days. Chelsea, meanwhile, look stronger with Diego Costa providing the missing link up front, and Cesc Fabregas excelling alongside him. City's need to assert themselves as champions is crucial, while a draw for Chelsea would be sufficient given their current momentum. The match's outcome will depend on whether City can summon one of their better performances or if Chelsea's consistency prevails."
9de26ce063e4dbcba57f3aeb9dadb36fd0fdd514,"**Not since the great Seve Ballesteros was in his heyday has a Spaniard descended on Wentworth with quite as much going for him as the remarkable Miguel Angel Jimenez at the BMW PGA Championship this week.**

*Who would dare argue now that 50 is not the new 30 after a month in which Jimenez appears to have lived out the ultimate middle-aged male fantasy?*

Let’s see: played at Augusta National and finished in the top four at the Masters; met up with his old mates on the Champions Tour and won his first event; came back home and got married to a woman half his age; played in his home Open and became the first golfer over the age of 50 to win on the European Tour. How’s that for a bucket list rattled off in the space of just 35 days?

**50 years young: Miguel Angel Jimenez is in prodigious form coming into this week's PGA Championship**

*27th time lucky: Jimenez was a popular winner of the Spanish Open at Catalunya Resort.*

As Jose Maria Olazabal said to him on the eve of the final round at Augusta: ‘You know how much I admired Seve, how much I learned from him, how he was my hero. Look at me. Today my hero is you.’

It’s not just Olazabal. There’s not a golfer at the European Tour’s flagship event who couldn’t learn from him.

The gym rats could learn you can be the fittest golfer in the world but it’s not much use if you’re not fit for golf. The strung-out obsessives could learn the value of a relaxing glass of wine and the importance of remembering that playing the game for a living remains an enormous privilege.

Those who only play well on certain courses could learn from the man who always begins every event with the odds stacked heavily against him but doesn’t know the meaning of the word ‘can’t’.

**Defying convention: The Spanish veteran takes his fun attitude towards life onto the course, and it works.**

And those . who place too much importance on appearance money, well they could learn . about loyalty from the man who kept his own European Tour event alive . with his own money as the Spanish economy hurtled towards oblivion; a . player who’d cut off his ponytail before he’d turn his back on the . European Masters in Switzerland because of how well they’ve treated him . over the years; who’s given up millions in senior golf earnings to . pursue his dream of becoming the oldest European to compete in the Ryder . Cup.

Sunday’s . fabulous feel-good victory at the Spanish Open - he won it for the . first time at the 27th attempt - showed just why he is right to believe. He might be one spot outside the automatic placings but right now he is . the only player with two victories to his name in full-field events . during the qualifying process.

And the Ryder Cup is all about winners.

**Love of his life: Jimenez with Susanne Styblo, who he married this month, ahead of the 2012 Ryder Cup.**

Married his birdie: Jimenez tied the knot with Susanna Styblo in Torremolinos this month .

How does he do it, with his funky swing, portly physique and the fact he gets outdriven by 40 yards on most holes? It has become perhaps the most oft-asked question in golf.

No-one ever supplied a better answer than former Open champion Tom Lehman. ‘He plays the game the way we all want to play. He has fun,’ said the former US Ryder Cup captain.

‘That’s the key to a long career. A big part of why Miguel is still so good is he carries over his philosophy of living to his game.’

And so it is that the middle-aged males, that most ubiquitous of golfing species in Britain, will arrive at Wentworth in their thousands this week with a little extra jaunt to their stride.

They thought it was something when their hero won the PGA at the age of 44. They marvelled when he came back from breaking his leg in a skiing accident to finish fourth last year at 49.

Now they watch as Jimenez continues to defy expectations, proving that age is just a number.

**Among the crowd will be Annabel, one of the youngest ever participants in the Ryder Cup**

Watching the top men close up, I’m hoping to pick up some playing and tactical hints,’ says Annabel.

**QUOTE OF THE WEEK. ‘We can’t wait to play at Wentworth and get the PGA crowd rocking. We’re all big golf fans, so it’s a gig we’re all looking forward to.’**

Who could have imagined a member of The Who saying that? Did rock get old or golf become young?

Anyway, Kenney Jones, who took over on drums when Keith Moon died, will lead his own band featuring former members of Bad Company, Procol Harum and Foreigner - if you’re under 30, ask your parents - in a free concert for PGA ticketholders on Saturday.","Jimenez takes form into the PGA Championship at Wentworth this week .
He finished top four at Augusta, won on the Champions Tour and won the Spanish Open after a play-off .
The Spaniard, 50, could teach his fitness fanatic opponents a thing or two .
Jimenez is known for valuing loyalty over lucrative appearance fees .

His approach to golf emphasizes fun and living in the moment, which has helped him defy convention and achieve great success. Jimenez is an inspiration to middle-aged men and has earned the admiration of golfers and fans alike. He's been praised by Jose Maria Olazabal as a hero who embodies the spirit of his idol Seve Ballesteros, and his example shows that age is just a number in golf."

I'd write up the opposition team on a flip chart, numbers 1 to 15, then their own team, and eyeball my players. ""What dressing room would you rather be in? What team sheet would you prefer?"" It was the England rugby dressing room, but it could also be the English football dressing room with Roy Hodgson addressing his players before this opening World Cup fixture against Italy.

""Would you want to be in our dressing room, with Steven Gerrard, Daniel Sturridge, and Wayne Rooney as your team-mates, or would you rather be on their team sheet?"" This is a very good Italian team who qualified with two games to spare, but England have nothing to fear. **Play to win**.

The closer to kick-off, the more important Roy's role becomes. His body language in the stadium will set the tone for his players. He should pick a team as if his life depended on it, not just a team that can come close to victory. **Pick a team to score goals**, and erase any negative thoughts about the heat and jungle conditions.

England are in good shape. They deserve credit for keeping focus on the football. All anyone is talking about is the line-up and who should play. There's no distraction from the WAGs or off-field scandals. Hodgson should take great credit for that, as it's not easy.

# A Winning Team
Now, going into a game of this nature, I would pick a team as if my life depended on it. Not a team to come close to victory but a team that would attack for victory. Just naming this team will set the tone of how England will play.

I would look at my rugby team and ask, ""Do we have the players to score five tries?"" Roy should be asking, ""Do we have the players to score three goals?"" If England score three, Italy will have to be very good not to lose. With that in mind, I would play Ross Barkley and Raheem Sterling, both brilliant attacking players who take the ball forwards, ask questions, and force mistakes from opponents with their pace and ability to run at players.

That would increase the pressure on Italy's players. England must keep the ball and hurt the opposition but above everything **play with great pace and energy**. Two questions for Roy with the same answer: Has he got the team? Yes. Can England win this? Yes. There is no Monday morning.","This is a very good Italian team who qualified with two games to spare, but England have nothing to fear .
Roy should be creating pressure in the team because the greatest athletes love pressure - that is why they do it .
There are many ways you create pressure but the most effective and easiest is to do everything - and I mean everything - faster than they are used to .
England are in good shape. They deserve a 'well done' for keeping the focus on the football .
I would play Ross Barkley and Raheem Sterling, both brilliant attacking players who take the ball forwards .
I hope he banishes any thought of 'a draw will do'. Take risks, create the mindset: 'We must win'. Pick a team to score goals .","England manager Roy Hodgson should not downplay the importance of their World Cup opener against Italy, but instead build pressure and create an expectation to win. He should convey confidence and belief in his team and remind them that this is a ""do or die"" situation. England's players, including Steven Gerrard and Wayne Rooney, should be told that they have nothing to fear from the Italian team. Hodgson should pick a team to score goals and create the mindset of winning, rather than aiming for a draw. He should focus on the basics of football, such as set-pieces, and play with great pace and energy. With a strong team and good preparation, England can overcome Italy and take control of their group."

Ursula Ward later returned to court this afternoon as proceedings got underway in the former New England Patriot player's murder trial in Fall River, Massachusetts. 

Hernandez, dressed in a sharp, dark suit, stared straight ahead and rocked from side to side, chewing gum as images of his friend, Odin Lloyd, flashed on a screen in front of him. He has pleaded not guilty to the murder. 

Hernandez's fiancée and mother of his young daughter, Shayanna Jenkins, sat behind him in court alongside his brother DJ and mother Terri. Mrs. Hernandez was also seen wiping tears away in the courtroom. Miss Jenkins' sister Shaneah sat with the victim's mother and other friends who wept at details of Lloyd's death. Shaneah was Mr. Lloyd's girlfriend at the time he was shot in the head and torso and dumped in a pit at an industrial park in June 2013. 

**WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT.** Former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez pictured in court on Thursday as his murder trial got underway in Fall River, Massachusetts. The former Pats player is accused of killing Odin Lloyd (pictured on the screen). The victim's mother, Ursula Ward, wept in court on Thursday as the prosecutor told the jury details of her son's violent death. 

Shayanna Jenkins, Hernandez's fiancée, looks on in court on Thursday during opening statements at his murder trial. Prosecutors have listed Shayanna Jenkins as a possible witness and this month petitioned the court to grant immunity to her, compelling her to testify. 

Hernandez and his defense lawyer stare at an image of Odin Lloyd's body as it was discovered at an industrial park in North Attlesboro, Massachusetts, in June 2013. Prosecutors said Hernandez and two friends, Carlos Ortiz and Ernest Wallace, picked Lloyd up at his home in Boston on June 17, drove him to the industrial park, and shot him dead. Prosecutors have not said who pulled the trigger but said Hernandez orchestrated the killing. Ortiz and Wallace have pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately. 

In opening statements on Thursday, District Attorney Patrick Bomberg took jurors through what he said was the sequence of events that led to Lloyd's killing. He played before-and-after footage that Bomberg said showed Lloyd getting into a car driven by Hernandez, then video taken shortly afterward at the NFL player's home, without Lloyd in the car. The prosecutor also presented an image taken off Hernandez's video surveillance system that showed Hernandez standing outside his basement, holding what Bomberg said was a gun. 

As the prosecutor showed jurors a photo of Lloyd's body, his mother was overcome and had to leave the courtroom briefly. He told the jury that Hernandez and his fiancée were the only people that Mr. Lloyd knew in North Attleboro where his body was found. He said Hernandez was unhappy with the victim, called up his friends, and then contacted Lloyd using other people's phones before trying to conceal that he had done so. He then claimed that Hernandez ""drove the victim to a secluded area and participated in killing and covered up the killing"". 

The jury was shown a photograph of Odin Lloyd's body, which was found by a high school student jogging home on June 17, 2013, in North Attleboro, Massachusetts. The prosecutor also said that a blunt—a marijuana cigarette—was found at the scene of Lloyd's body which had Hernandez's DNA on it. 

Defense lawyer, Michael Fee, began his remarks on Thursday just before 1 p.m., announcing: *""Aaron Hernandez is an innocent man.""* The attorney said that Hernandez had been targeted by police and prosecutors in a ""sloppy"" investigation because he was a celebrity and a Patriots player. *""Aaron never had a chance,""* Fee said. *""They locked on Aaron and they targeted him.""* He said the evidence would show that Hernandez did not kill Lloyd and did not ask anyone to do so. He said authorities could offer no motive for the killing. 

*""The investigation was sloppy and unprofessional. What about the facts that showed Aaron's innocence?""* he said. *""The evidence will show that they were ignored.""* A surveillance image from the football player's home, which appears to show him standing outside his basement holding a gun—although this was strongly disputed by the defense. 

Family members and friends of Odin Lloyd sobbed as the lead prosecutor described his brutal murder and gunshot wounds. Fee admitted that Hernandez and Lloyd liked to smoke marijuana together and go out on the town to pick up girls. He claimed that friends were desperate to hang out with Hernandez because of his NFL status and how he picked up the tab and was so generous—often hiring cars for his friends to use. 

The defense attorney also claimed that two nights before his murder, Hernandez gave Lloyd the keys to a rental SUV after partying all night with two women. The keys were later found on Lloyd's body. Fee claimed that the Pats player had contacted his friend Odin on the night of his death, only to see if he wanted to party—and not for any other reason. Noting that Hernandez had a long-term football contract, a new house, a fiancée, and a seven-month-old baby, the defense attorney said: *""In June of 2013, Aaron Hernandez was planning a future, not a murder.""* 

Terri Hernandez, center, mother of Aaron Hernandez, watches during her son's murder trial on Thursday. She was also in tears during the opening statements. Evidence that Hernandez was at the scene is not enough to convict him, Fee said. *""Mere presence is not enough. We can't be convicted of a crime just because we hang with the wrong people or are in the wrong place,""* he told the jury. 

On Thursday afternoon, the prosecution called Odin Lloyd's former employer, who said Lloyd had failed to turn up for work on June 17 and the following day. The employer said that he had called or texted Lloyd but received no response. Later that day, he learned that Lloyd, whom he employed at his fertilizer company, had died. 

The prosecution then called 17-year-old Matthew Kent to the stand. The high school student was the first to report finding Lloyd's body as he took a shortcut on his job home through a construction site. The teen testified that Lloyd was lying on his back and did not respond when he twice asked if he was alright. The boy then ran to a nearby business for help where a man called 911. The teen described the scene, saying that a red baseball hat was lying above the man's head and a white rag near his feet. Mr. Kent also said that there were tire tracks for about 30 feet close to the body. The prosecution then entered into exhibits two images of the victim's body, lying face up on the dirt. 

Hernandez often leaned forward in court, paying close attention to opening statements and witness testimony, including the account of Matthew Kent. Victim Odin Lloyd's mother (pictured in the purple suit) with his girlfriend Shaneah Jenkins to her left. 

The swearing-in began on Thursday morning after some brief delays involving jury issues. One juror was late getting to court, and another juror sent a note to the judge. Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh then began individually questioning jurors. A jury of 13 women and five men was seated by Bristol County Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh on Monday after more than two weeks of jury selection. Six of the 18 jurors were randomly selected as alternates just before deliberations started. Garsh instructed jurors not to talk to anyone about the case or share details of the trial with anyone in any manner, including through social media. 

The murder trial gets underway just days before Hernandez's former team plays in the Super Bowl. Sunday's Super Bowl will be the Patriots' first appearance since 2012, when Hernandez caught a touchdown pass in Super Bowl XLVI. At the time he seemed to be a man with a bright future. At age 23, he had a Super Bowl appearance under his belt and a $40 million contract as a star tight end with the team. He and his fiancée had started a family and were living in a mansion in the Boston suburbs with their 8-month-old daughter. 

But at the opening of the trial, prosecutors have started to paint a different picture of Hernandez as a killer who orchestrated the shooting of semiprofessional football player Lloyd. At 23, Hernandez had a Super Bowl appearance under his belt and a $40 million contract as a star tight end with the New England Patriots, but then he was arrested in June 2013 and charged with murder. 

Hernandez was arrested on 26 June 2013, just days after Lloyd's bullet-riddled body was found in an industrial park near his North Attleboro mansion. The Patriots cut him less than two hours after he was arrested. Prosecutors have listed Shayanna Jenkins as a possible witness and this month petitioned the court to grant immunity to her. That could compel her to testify. The court has not said whether it was granted. 

Thursday was the first day since the petition was heard that Jenkins appeared in the courtroom. Hernandez, now 25, has also been charged with killing two men in Boston in 2012 because he felt disrespected after one of them spilled a drink on him at a nightclub. He pleaded not guilty after being charged in those shootings in May, and the case has not yet gone to trial. 

Prosecutors have said Hernandez may have showed Lloyd the spot where a 2012 double homicide took place in Boston. Prosecutors suggested Lloyd's knowledge of the 2012 killings was a possible motive in his slaying. The judge has ruled that prosecutors will not be allowed to tell the jury about the 2012 Boston killings.","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

## A 4-Day-Old Kitten Found with His Eyes Still Shut in September 2013

A kitten that has no front legs after being reportedly hit by a weed whacker is thriving -- and steadily gaining fans on Facebook. Mercury the kitten was found 4 days old with his eyes still shut in September 2013, his owners write on his own Facebook fan page, Raising Mercury.

## Video: A Kitten Overcoming Adversity

 Mercury the kitten, seen here, reportedly lost his front limbs after an accident with a weed whacker .

### Found and Adopted by New Owners

Found with his eyes closed and only 4 days old in September 2013, Mercury was taken in and eventually adopted by his new owners .

## Details of the Accident

'We believe he was hit with a weed whacker since people in the neighbourhood had been doing yard work in tall grass shortly before he was found,' they write.

### Caring for Mercury's Wounds

He was taken to our vet, his wounds were cleaned up, and we were then called to care for him since we do a lot of bottle babies and special needs kitties for rescues. We fed him around the clock, and cleaned his wounds multiple times a day until they fully closed over.

## The Journey So Far

Though they had considered giving Mercury up for adoption, they decided they 'simply cannot part with him.' Mercury has developed his hind legs, they write, and is able to use them to push himself, balance upright, and jump. Despite not being able to use his now-amputated front limbs, Mercury's hind legs have developed an allow a wide range of movement .

### The Current State of Mercury's Front Limbs

Mercury's Facebook page run by his owners, Raising Mercury, currently has 9,350 likes . Mercury's right arm stops just before where his elbow would be and his left arm extends slightly after it, they explain. His front limbs reportedly cause him no pain.

## Future Plans for Mercury

His left rear foot only has one toe. Mercury's owners say he is not a candidate for a prothestic leg on either front limb, since he would need at least 40% of the limb intact. After he stops growing, he may be eligible for a front wheel chair. However, they say he would also need a harness and that his limited chest muscles might prevent it from working.

## Mercury's Future as a Therapy Cat

Mercury is expected to attend adoption events to help raise awareness of cats with disabilities, and his owners say they hope for him to one day become a therapy cat. Mercury's hind legs are developing, allowing him to jump and even stand upright, like in the photo seen here .","Found four days old after his front legs were allegedly amputated by a weed whacker .

With over 9,350 likes on his Facebook page, ""Raising Mercury,"" the kitten is gaining fans and attention. His owners have decided not to give him up for adoption, hoping instead to help raise awareness about cats with disabilities through adoption events. Eventually, they may consider a front wheel chair to help Mercury's mobility, but only after he stops growing."

## Family of Three Found Dead in Wichita Home

Vinh Van Nguyen, 41 (pictured), was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of killing his girlfriend, 45-year-old Tuyet Huynh, her 20-year-old daughter Trinh Pham and son-in-law Sean Pham, 21.

A quiet family of three was found shot to death in their Wichita, Kansas home early Tuesday, and the matriarch's boyfriend is suspected of carrying out the grisly crime. Vinh Van Nguyen, 41, was arrested after police found him in the master bedroom with his dead girlfriend, 45-year-old homeowner Tuyet Huynh.

## Bodies Found on Ground Floor

Huynh's 20-year-old daughter Trinh Pham and son-in-law Sean Pham, 21, were also found gunned down in the suburban residence. The only person in the house unharmed besides the suspect, was the Pham's 5-month-old son Carsen.

## Police Still Investigating

Police are still investigating what sparked the triple homicide, and say there were no previous cases of domestic violence or criminal activity at the residence. Trinh Pham is believed to be the family member who called 911 just after midnight, while the shooting was still raging.

## Officers Responded Too Late

Officers responded within minutes of Mrs Pham's call, but were too late. By the time they circled the home on the 2200 block of South Beech Street, they could already see the bodies of Ms Huynh and Mr Pham lying dead on the ground floor.

## Nguyen Arrested Without Resistance

Ms Huynh was found in the master bedroom along with her boyfriend, while Mr Pham was found in the hallway. Nguyen is being held on $2million bond at the Sedgewick County Jail on multiple counts of capital murder. Formal charges against Nguyen are expected later this week.

## Family Members and Neighbors Describe the Victims

According to police, the suspect and victims lived in the house together, and have been described by neighbors as a quiet family. The Pham couple was recent graduates of Wichita's East High School.

## Community Reacts to Tragedy

A close friend of Sean Pham has set up a Go Fund Me page to help cover funeral expenses. As of Tuesday evening, the fund had raised more than $4,000 of its $15,000 goal. The 5-month-old baby is now in the care of family members.

## Additional Daughter Affected

Ms Huynh had another younger daughter who was staying with family at the time of the shooting.","Victims have been identifeid as Tuyet Huynh, 45, her 20-year-old daughter Trinh Pham and son-in-law Sean Pham, 21 .

A 5-month-old son of Trinh and Sean Pham survived the attack and is now in the care of family members. Police are still investigating what sparked the triple homicide, but there were no previous reports of domestic violence or criminal activity at the residence.

At the height of the Mid Staffordshire scandal, Sir David Nicholson toured wards and in a follow-up letter said ‘well done’ for ‘progress in target areas’. The visit came in October 2005 – a year in which 300 patients are thought to have died because of poor care. By 2009, the total stood at 1,200.

**Bereaved Families Call for Sir David to Quit**

Bereaved families, who are calling for Sir David to quit, say many lives could have been spared had he investigated the health trust. In other developments in the NHS crisis:

The letter obtained by the Mail shows the NHS chief visited Mid Staffordshire’s two hospitals – Stafford and Cannock Chase – while he was in charge of the regional health board. It is thought the visit was on October 27 and was followed by a letter of congratulation to the chief executive. It noted improvements on hitting targets for waiting times in casualty, cancer treatment, surgery, and outpatients.

Yet that month an elderly woman who had suffered a stroke was sent home by a casualty doctor who misdiagnosed her as having a urine infection. The visit came in October 2005 – a year in which 300 patients are thought to have died because of poor care. By 2009, the total stood at 1,200.

**Scandal Deepens**

Julie Bailey, who set up the campaign group Cure the NHS after her mother died at the trust, said: ‘He should have been asking questions of the trust’s chief executive, not congratulating him. The care was just disastrous from 2004 and it became a longstanding problem. He is ultimately responsible. How can he carry on in his job after all this?’ Last week Sir David was implicated in another scandal when it emerged he had ignored warnings about a hospital trust where 670 patients may have died needlessly.

Gary Walker and David Bowles, the former chief executive and chairman of United Lincolnshire Hospitals, say they wrote to the chief executive in 2009 but were ignored. Mr Walker was later sacked and given a £500,000 pay-off with a gagging clause to keep silent. The trust is being investigated by the NHS for having one of the highest death rates in the country.

**Pressure on Sir David**

Yesterday, the Prime Minister added to the pressure by saying the NHS needed to act on problems ‘much more swiftly’. Mr Cameron said there had been ‘no accountability’ for the failings at Mid Staffordshire with those responsible being allowed to quietly retire or move on. Speaking from Mumbai, he added: ‘There wasn’t proper accountability. There weren’t proper consequences and that is not acceptable.’

Last week Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt wrote to all health trusts urging them not to use gagging orders to deter whistleblowing. Asked about this, the Prime Minister said: ‘I agree with what Jeremy Hunt has said over the last couple of days. You shouldn’t need to rely on whistleblowing in the NHS, we should be discovering problems much more swiftly. We should be discovering them as they occur.’

**Sir David Faces Calls to Resign**

Gary Walker (left) and David Bowles (right), the former chief executive and chairman of United Lincolnshire Hospitals, say they wrote to the chief executive in 2009 but were ignored.

Mr Cameron said the Government was trying to get hospital trusts to provide better care by asking patients whether they would recommend them to their friends and family. But he made clear where this fails, there is a case for whistleblowing: ‘That’s what the transparency agenda is about. That’s what the friends and family test is about, that’s what boosting the Care Quality Commission is all about. That’s what the chief inspector of hospitals is all about.

**Sir David's Record**

Sir David has been facing increasing calls to resign since a report into the Mid Staffordshire scandal was published earlier this month. Sir David also appointed the trust’s failed chief executive Martin Yeates – even though he had no formal managerial training and went on to sack 50 nurses. Later, as chief executive of the Department of Health, he is said to have dismissed warnings from relatives.

He apparently told a watchdog investigating the hospital trust that the failures were ‘system wide’. But last week two Tory MPs from the health select committee, Chris Skidmore and Sarah Wollaston, urged him to consider his position. An online petition on a Government website calling on him to go has received 3,796 signatures.

A spokesman for Sir David Nicholson said: ‘Sir David took on responsibility for the Shropshire and Staffordshire Health Authority for just ten months, along with being chief executive of two other health authorities. There was no information that he saw during that time that alerted him to the problems at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust.’","Sir David .

By 2009, up to 1,200 patients had died unnecessarily, with many suffering from ""inhumane"" and ""inexcusable"" treatment. Families have called for Nicholson's resignation, saying he should have investigated the trust instead of congratulating its executives. The Prime Minister has added pressure, stating that there was a lack of accountability and swift action in addressing the scandal.

**PUBLISHED:** 08:11 EST, 19 August 2013  
**UPDATED:** 16:54 EST, 19 August 2013  

Major League Baseball today said it would waive the confidentiality clause in its drug testing program to release all documents relating to treatment of beleaguered Yankees player, Alex Rodriguez, as his lawyer insisted he will not serve a single inning of his 211-match ban. Attorney Joe Tacopina was presented with a letter from MLB on the Today show stating that it was prepared to release the information and host Matt Lauer asked the lawyer to sign it. 

> ""We would love nothing more than to discuss his testing history,"" Tacopina responded, saying the investigation had been ""rife with misconduct."" 

But on Monday afternoon, he rejected the offer, even though the letter stated that Rodriguez's side could also disclose all documents they wanted. He called it a ""publicity stunt"" and a ""trap.""


### Speaking out

Alex Rodriguez's lawyer Joe Tacopina said his client should not serve a single inning of his 211-match ban because evidence against him using performance-enhancing drugs will not stand up in court. Tacopina and A-Rod have been accused of using the confidentiality agreement as a barrier put up to avoid answering whether or not he took performance-enhancing drugs. 

It comes as an alleged former mistress of Yankee's boss Brian Cashman claimed he knew about steroid use within the team but did nothing about it in explosive court papers filed today. MLB said it would readily release information on A-Rod's prior violations, communications, text messages, and instant messages related to his treatment by Anthony Bosch, who founded the Miami-based Biogenesis anti-aging clinic linked to performing-enhancing drugs. A-Rod has been served a 211-game ban for taking the drugs, but he remains on the field while appealing the decision. All 13 other players accused of the drug use have accepted their bans.

### Stubborn

Tacopina did not say if he would sign a letter from MLB to waive confidentiality of the drug testing. Speaking to Today, Tacopina also took aim at the Yankees, accusing its management of purposefully keeping his client in the dark about his ailing health. He presented an MRI scan to the show which he claimed would reveal that A-Rod had a hole in his left hip on October 11, 2012, which he claimed the Yankees did not tell his client. 

> ""Nobody told Alex Rodriguez that he had a hole in his left hip - nobody,"" Tacopina said. ""He didn't know until he went to his own doctor.""

Lauer said an independent doctor was looking at the scan. Tacopina admitted he did not know why the team would purposefully withhold the medical information, but suggested they wanted to make him a ""scapegoat.""

### Controversy

Alex Rodriguez, pictured at Sunday's Yankees Red Sox game, has been banned from playing for 211 games but is still allowed on the field while he appeals the ban. Claims: Yankees boss Brian Cashman's alleged mistress Louise Meanwell said he was aware of the steroid use. Court papers filed today allege that Yankee’s boss Brian Cashman knew about steroid use within the team but did nothing about it, instead adopting a ""win-at-any-cost"" attitude. The papers were filed on behalf of Louise Meanwell, who allegedly had an affair with Cashman in late 2011 while he was still married. 

Meanwell claimed she fell pregnant with his child at the time and he paid for an abortion. He, in turn, accused her of stalking him and extorting $6,000 to keep quiet about their relationship. She was arraigned on grand larceny, stalking, and harassment charges in February 2012 and spent five months in Rikers Island prison. The British native claims Cashman told her of steroid use within the Yankees, naming specific players, and admitted intentionally misleading federal investigators during the Roger Clemens investigation, according to court papers. 

It also states: 

> ""Mr Cashman was ambivalent to the use of performance enhancing drugs so long as nothing came back to the Yankee’s organization…and shared with [Meanwell] his win-at-any-cost attitude.""

The papers were filed citing a conflict of interest because Alex Rodriguez’s lawyer Joe Tacopina and Meanwell’s lawyer Stephen Turano form the law offices of Tacopina Seigel & Turano, P.C. 

### Vigilante Justice

Red Sox Ryan Dempster seemed to intentionally hit A-Rod with a pitch in Sunday night's game at Fenway Park, making for a tense atmosphere throughout the game. 

**Impact:** The ball can be seen hitting A-Rod on Sunday after umpires say he was intentionally struck. Meanwell said she relayed all of the details of her conversations with Cashman to Turano and was not informed when the firm started representing Rodriguez, who denies using performance-enhancing drugs. 

**Connection?** MLB said it will release information about A-Rod's treatment by Anthony Bosch, pictured. 

The papers state: 

> ""Mr Rodriguez and his current circumstance is consistent with a New York Yankee management takedown, as was in the case of [Meanwell]. While it appears the Yankee organization is attempting to get out from under a $100million obligation to Rodriguez, Meanwell’s interests are not so consistent with the baseball player’s as for her to give consent to the law firm to represent Rodriguez’s possible divergent interests.""

The appearance by Tacopina comes just hours after a tense performance by A-Rod on Sunday, in which he was hit by a fastball from Boston Red Sox starter Ryan Dempster. A-Rod responded by hitting his 649th career home run, prompting even more boos and derisive chants from spectators reeling from the accusations against him. Dempster appeared to take aim at Rodriguez and both teams were given a warning. 

Rodriguez, 38, has been condemned by fans and the MLB for appealing which has allowed him to carry on playing for the Yankees. Yankees fans are also concerned he will prove an embarrassment as the season goes on, especially as he is on a 10-year, $275million contract that will see him play for the team through the 2016 season. 

Rodriguez has previously admitted to using performance-enhancing drugs between 2001 and 2003 when he played with the Texas Rangers. 

### Beleaguered

A-Rod has enraged fans by refusing to accept the ban for allegedly taking the drugs. Rodriguez has consistently denied using banned drugs linked to Bosch and says he has never been treated by him. In a statement, his lawyer David Cornwell said: 

> ""The allegations are untrue and are another attempt to harm Alex - this time by driving a wedge between Alex and other players in the game.""

""While Alex focuses on baseball and repeatedly states that he is going to respect the appeal process, the drumbeat of false allegations continues."" 

In his latest comments on the scandal, MLB commissioner Bud Siegel said that he was ""very comfortable"" with the way its investigation had gone. He said: 

> ""I have a job to do, and the job is to protect the integrity of the sport and enforce our program, and that's what I'm going to do. We made a commitment, and I made a commitment to a lot of people and a lot of entities, that we would do everything we can to clean up this sport. We have, we will and we will continue to do so.""

Other major leaguers also have spoken out, criticizing players penalized for using performance-enhancing drugs for the damage they've done to baseball. Boston pitcher John Lackey recently said he had a problem with Rodriguez being allowed to play while his suspension is under appeal.","Attorney Joe Tacopina appeared on the Today show on Monday an said accusations against the baseball player 'will never stand up' in court .
MLB said it will waive the confidentiality clause in its drug testing program but Tacopina REJECTS the offer .
Tacopina said the Yankees purposefully kept A-Rod in the dark about his injury last year - and said an MRI scan would prove it .
Brian Cashman alleged mistress claims he knew about steroid use in the Yankees and turned a blind eye .
On Sunday, Red Sox pitcher Ryan Dempster apparently purposefully struck A-Rod, sparking anger on the field and through the stands .","Major League Baseball (MLB) announced it would waive the confidentiality clause in its drug testing program to release documents related to Alex Rodriguez's treatment. His lawyer, Joe Tacopina, rejected this offer, calling it a ""publicity stunt"" and claiming evidence against Rodriguez regarding performance-enhancing drug use would not hold up in court. Tacopina accused the Yankees of withholding crucial medical information from Rodriguez, including an MRI revealing a hip issue. Meanwhile, allegations surfaced that Yankees boss Brian Cashman was aware of steroid use among players but did nothing. Rodriguez, banned for 211 games, continues to appeal while maintaining his innocence. MLB Commissioner Bud Siegel expressed confidence in the investigation, emphasizing the need to uphold the sport's integrity amid ongoing controversy."

For thousands of years they have occupied the world of fantasy, fairy tale, and folklore. The half-human, half-fish creatures first appeared in ancient Assyria, now Syria, when the goddess Atargatis transformed herself into a mermaid out of shame, having accidentally killed her human lover.

In history the seductive creatures have been linked to perilous events in European, African, and Asian culture, including floods, storms, shipwrecks, and drownings. And they are associated with Greek mythology, Homer having referred to them as sirens - dangerous, yet beautiful creatures, who lured sailors to shipwreck.

Hans Christian Andersen's well-known fairy tale The Little Mermaid was transformed into a Disney classic and mermaids have also been depicted in operas, paintings, books, films, and comics. But could the concept actually have been derived from a real medical condition?

## Sirenomelia, also known as 'Mermaid syndrome' is a life-threatening illness.

Marked by the rotation and fusion of a sufferer's legs, the rare congenital deformity causes what looks like a single limb, resembling a fish tail, in the womb. Medical historian Lindsey Fitzharris, who has a PhD from Oxford University, told MailOnline that the condition occurs from a failure of the normal vascular supply, when the umbilical cord fails to form two arteries.

As a result there is not sufficient blood supply reaching the fetus, she said. The single artery ""steals"" the blood and nutrition from the lower body, diverting it back up into the placenta. Suffering malnutrition, the fetus fails to develop two separate limbs.

The condition is extremely rare, affecting one in 100,000 babies, but is 100 times more likely to occur in identical twins. Babies born with the condition rarely live beyond a few days, with more than half of cases resulting in stillbirth.

Dr. Fitzharris, author of the blog The Chirurgeon's Apprentice, said: ""Over the course of my research, I've found very little about the disorder's history. There are snippets here and there which claim that fetuses born with sirenomelia were sometimes preserved in jars and put on display in 'freak shows' during the 19th century.

But these sources are frustratingly vague. There is a brief mention of the condition in a four-volume atlas published in 1891 titled Human Monstrosities, but nothing that hints at how medical practitioners understood sirenomelia in earlier periods.

Perhaps because the disorder is so rare, it's also been hard for me to locate specimens in anatomical collections. My search in the Hunterian Museum at the Royal College of Surgeons in London came up cold.""

But medical historian Lindsey Fitzharris said the inspiration for the mythical creature could come from a real medical condition.

## Sirenomelia survivor: Peruvian girl Milagros Cerron

In 2006, a team of eight specialists successfully carried out a second operation on the then two-year-old Milagros Cerron. The youngster, whose first name means ""miracles"" in Spanish, was born with the rare congenital disorder.

Her legs were fused from groin to ankles and her feet splayed, in the characteristic form of sirenomelia. Most of Milagros's internal organs, including her heart and lungs, were in perfect condition. But she was born with serious internal defects, including a deformed left kidney and a very small right kidney located very low in her body.

Her digestive, urinary tracts, and genitals also shared a single tube. In June 2005, doctors successfully performed the first in a series of risky operations to separate Milagros's lower legs, to above her knees.

The second operation was carried out to separate the remaining fused tissue, from her knees to groin. Surgeon Luis Rubio, who led the specialists, said after the second surgery: ""There were no problems, no complications from anesthesia or from hemorrhaging.""

He said Milagros had developed the ability to stand alone without help and take small assisted steps.

In 2012, the then seven-year-old required a kidney transplant, part of surgery to reconstruct her urinary tract. Rubio said at the time that Tiffany Yorks was the only other person known to have undergone successful surgery to correct the rare congenital defect.

In 2006, the surgeon calculated Milagros would need at least 16 more operations over the course of the next decade to reconstruct and repair her digestive, urinary, and sexual organs.","Mermaids have dominated fantasy and folklore for thousands of years .

## Southampton and England striker Rickie Lambert looks poised to join his boyhood club Liverpool, who released him as a 15-year-old.
### We asked David Tyrer of fan website Live4Liverpool where he sees the Scouser fitting in to Brendan Rodgers' team and how likely the big man is to succeed.

#### Hardly a fortnight has passed since the season ended and Liverpool have been linked with nearly half of Southampton's first team. Adam Lallana, Dejan Lovren, Nathaniel Clyne, even Luke Shaw's name has been thrown up.
##### But when Rickie Lambert became the first that the south coast side had received an official bid from Liverpool for it was a shock, to say the least.

Taking to Twitter you could see the concern from many - was this another Andy Carroll in the making? Another Englishman who's ability has been incorrectly inflated by his nationality?
#### Listening to some, it would seem so.
But being a Scouser at Liverpool means much more than being English; it can often afford you more time to prove yourself and, as we've seen in the case of Jon Flanagan, that is no bad thing. It is for this reason (although, not this reason alone) that Lambert's proposed move to Liverpool was greeted by most fans with a kind of whimsical positivity.

### Goalscorer: Liverpool target Rickie Lambert (left) celebrates scoring for Southampton this season.
#### On target: Lambert shows his delight in notching goals for bother England (left) and Southampton.

'Good for him!' is the almost resounding sentiment, as it is rare that a local lad finally gets the opportunity to play for a club whose crest he has emblazoned on his shoulder at 32, though it should be noted that this move is in no way sentimental by the club.
#### Sure, the fact that Rickie’s a Scouser will almost certainly help, in that he'll likely give that elusive 'extra 10 per cent' but there is no doubting he is being brought in to do a very specific job.
While Daniel Sturridge and Luis Suarez will undoubtedly still be the club's main strike-force, Lambert is being purchased for those games when all the skill and trickery in the world get you nowhere, for when you need a totally different approach.

#### It may now be a dirty phrase in English football but Lambert is a 'traditional centre forward' and at times Liverpool lacked that last season.
With the increase in games next season too it would be much more heartening to have an option like Lambert from the bench than Victor Moses or Iago Aspas.

### Working hard: Lambert goes through his training drills for England ahead of this summer's World Cup in Brazil.
#### Other Saints targets: Liverpool are also keen on Southampton's Adam Lallana (left) and Dejan Lovren.
Not another Carroll: The differences between Lambert and Liverpool flop Andy Carroll's games look clear.

Many may cry 'What was wrong with Carroll?!' but while their games are somewhat similar, the resounding difference is that Lambert is an experienced, canny pro and - most importantly - scores goals: 28 in his last 2 Premier League seasons, to be precise. Can you really grumble at a 15 goal-a-season striker for £4 million?
#### Oh, and did I mention he's a Scouser?

Read more of David's opinions at Live4Liverpool and on Twitter @Live4Liverpool.","Rickie Lambert's move to Liverpool has been received positively by the fans .
Being a Scouser at Liverpool means much more than being English - it affords you more time to prove yourself .
Lambert is being brought in for those games when all the skill and trickery get you nowhere - when you need a more direct approach .
The Southampton striker is a much stronger option from the bench than Iago Aspas or Victor Moses .
Comparisons with Liverpool flop Andy Carroll are incorrect - Lambert is an experienced, canny pro with a proven Premier League scoring record .","Rickie Lambert, Southampton and England striker, is set to join his boyhood club Liverpool. Despite concerns that he may be another Andy Carroll, who failed to live up to expectations after signing for the Reds, fans are cautiously optimistic about Lambert's potential success. As a local Scouser, Lambert will likely receive more time to prove himself, but it's not just sentimental reasons behind the move. He is being brought in to provide a different approach on the pitch, particularly during games when skill and trickery don't work. With his experience and ability to score goals (28 in his last 2 Premier League seasons), many believe Lambert will be a valuable addition to Liverpool's squad, especially considering his price tag of £4 million."

## A ""Cold-blooded and Ruthless"" Doctor Convicted of 11 Sex Attacks on Six Girls He Was Treating

Dr. Michael Salmon, an 80-year-old doctor who sexually assaulted patients as young as 12 at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, has been jailed for 18 years.

### The Serial Offender

Salmon was convicted of a string of rapes and indecent assaults on seriously ill patients between 1980 and 1988. He lured a 16-year-old girl to his home where he raped her in his bedroom.

## ""A Predator's Paradise""

Other vulnerable teenagers were molested at the Buckinghamshire hospital, often while their unsuspecting parents sat on the other side of a screen. This abuse was allowed to take place for nearly a decade.

### A Double Life

Salmon reinvented himself as a wildlife expert and bought a £700,000 home in Woodgreen, where he told neighbors he was a distinguished retired hospital consultant with aristocratic connections.

## ""A Sneery"" Neighbor

Residents described him as sneery, pompous, and haughty. One neighbor said: 'He told us he was related to the Percy family of Northumberland.'

### Unmasking the Predator

When contacted by The Mail, the Natural History Museum in London said it had never heard of Salmon. He claimed to have traveled with the BBC Natural History Unit and boasted about his book on British butterflies.

## ""A Dirty Old Man""

Residents in Woodgreen had long held suspicions about Salmon's past. One neighbor told The Mail: 'I thought he was a dirty old man.'

### A Judge's Verdict

Judge Johanna Cutts QC said Salmon was a predatory paedophile who treated the girls as objects for his sexual gratification.

## ""A Lot of Rape Cases""

She added that it is rare to see such cold-blooded and ruthless behavior. Speaking about one victim, the judge said: 'You raped her at a time when she couldn’t have been more vulnerable.'

### Victims Speak Out

Salmon's victims wept in the public gallery as they gave moving victim impact statements. One said she suffered nightmares, while another said she couldn't get Salmon's face out of her head.

## ""The Most Despicable Crimes Imaginable""

Jessica Standley, an abuse lawyer at Slater and Gordon, said: 'The crimes he committed were among the most despicable imaginable.'

### Serious Questions Raised

This case raises serious questions about the culture at Stoke Mandeville Hospital during the time Jimmy Savile was there.","Paediatrician Michael Salmon abused girls as young as 12 in the 1980s .
Doctor jailed for nine indecent assaults on patients and two rapes .
Sex attacks at Stoke Mandeville were at the same time as Savile's abuse .

*On Monday*, jurors were shown the horrific moment a 76-year-old Dallas grandmother and convenience store clerk was doused in lighter fluid and set on fire during an early morning hold-up.

The shocking surveillance footage came as Nancy Harris' distraught son, Scott Harris, described in testimony the heartbreak he felt as he was told while getting ready for church that his mother had suffered burns to 40 per cent of her body in the senseless attack. She died several days later.

**Horrific Moment**

Jurors were today shown the horrific moment a 76-year-old Dallas convenience store clerk Nancy Harris, pictured, was doused in lighter fluid and set alight during a hold-up.

He said Harris - who had three other children - didn't want to be kept alive if she couldn't live as she had, so she was taken off life support and died five days later. 'She could not communicate,' Scott Harris said, adding that his mother was sedated.

**Death Penalty Trial**

Matthew Johnson, 38, is on trial for capital murder in the slaying. Prosecutors are pushing for the death sentence in the disturbing case.

The footage, from a surveillance camera at the Fina Whip-In at the corner of Broadway and Colonel Drive in Garland, shows Johnson pour lighter fluid from a water bottle over Harris' head. Before he set her alight, he stood behind her taking cigarettes and a lighter as she opened the cash register.

However, as she struggles to open it, Johnson attempts to pull a ring off her right hand but it won't budge. He licks his finger and tries again but it still won't move. He tries once more, this time successfully. He is then seen walking away from the store as an orange glow becomes visible behind him.

The video shows Harris on fire for more than two minutes, according to Dallasnews.com. She desperately tries to put out the fire in a sink but when she cannot she walks outside to call for help. According to testimony, two police officers who spotted the blaze and heard Harris' screams used a fire extinguisher to put out the fire.

When paramedics arrived a short time later, the woman begged them to administer aid, 'help me, help me, help me,' she told them. Incredibly, she was able to describe her attacker.

**Johnson Arrested**

Johnson was arrested shortly after in a nearby neighborhood when residents began to call 911 to report that a man was trying to break into their homes. Harris' ring was found in Johnson's pocket, police said.

Facing death: Johnson, 38, pictured in court on Monday, has confessed to the senseless slaying of the mother-of-four on a Sunday morning in May 2012, Garland police say.

**Crime Scene**

The footage, from a surveillance camera at the Fina Whip-In at the corner of Broadway and Colonel Drive in Garland, pictured, shows Johnson pour lighter fluid from a water bottle over Harris' head.

Prosecutors showed a second video to jurors on Monday, with Johnson sitting in the back of a patrol car shirtless and behaving erratically. Officer Billy Coffey, who is driving Johnson to jail, tells Johnson that he is accused of capital murder, to which the suspect responds.

**Johnson's Reaction**

'Capital murder? What you talking about, man?' Johnson asks in the video. 'Capital murder on who, man?' According to Dallasnews.com, Johnson later tells Coffey that the police only caught him because he wanted to be caught.

Harris suffered burns over 40 per cent of her body. She did not know Johnson, police said.","Jurors in Dallas were visibly shaken on Monday as they watched Nancy Harris frantically try to extinguish the fire that would ultimately kill her .

A young man who suffered a horrific brain injury will embark on an incredible charity bike ride as a moving memorial for his friend, Kim Hunt, who was killed in a tragic murder-suicide. 

Ms. Hunt, a beloved intensive care nurse, wife, and mother, was found dead in September last year as a result of a suspected murder-suicide. Her husband Geoff and their three young children, Fletcher, Mia, and Phoebe, were also tragically found dead on their country property, all with gunshot wounds. 

Mrs. Hunt suffered from a traumatic brain injury after a car crash in 2012. Just weeks beforehand and mere kilometres away, fellow Lockhart resident Luke Stojanovic sustained very similar injuries after a bike accident. 

![A photograph taken of friend Kim Hunt (left) and Luke Stojanovic (right) before Kim's tragic death, during one of their 'many dinners in the courtyard together at Liverpool Brain Injury Unit.'](image_url)  
The Hunt family: Geoff (back left), Kim (back right), and their children (left to right) Phoebe, Mia, and Fletcher, were all tragically killed in a suspected murder-suicide in September 2014.

Luke Stojanovic (left) just days after his accident at the high dependency ward in Canberra with his lifelong best friend, motocross champion Jackson Strong.

Stojanovic, 22, is now preparing to ride to honour Mrs. Hunt and to raise money for the Liverpool Brain Trauma Unit and Wagga Base Hospital Intensive Care Unit. The hospitals were vital in helping both himself and Mrs. Hunt recover from their traumatic brain injuries and are also the place where their friendship was formed.

The road ride has long been a dream for the 22-year-old, and he had often discussed his plans with Ms. Hunt. 

> “Kim had indicated that she would like to support Luke by riding part of the way with him,” family friend and fundraiser organiser, Mandy Strong, told Daily Mail Australia. “We say to him, ‘Kim is there with you, she’s just sitting on your shoulder keeping you going.’”

Stojanovic will ride a staggering **180 kilometres** on his charity ride. He will set off from Ramsay Private Hospital in Nowra, where he is currently undergoing rehabilitation as an outpatient, and finish in Liverpool, where he spent nine months after his accident.

Mr. Stojanovic (left) and Mrs. Hunt (right) were both Lockhart residents and formed a close friendship as they fought to overcome their brain injuries. 

Kim (in red, holding daughter Mia) is remembered as a loving wife, mother, and friend. She was also a dedicated intensive care nurse and showed incredible strength to overcome a horrific brain injury.

> “I am calling my ride the Luke Stono’s ‘Never Give Up Ride,’” said Mr. Stojanovic. “I want to undertake this fundraising event to help others like myself so they can better themselves and be the best they can be.” 

He hopes to complete the ride in **10 days** from April 22 to May 1. 

> “I will do this by riding a recumbent push bike that has been specially modified to suit my disability,” explained Stojanovic. 

The driven 22-year-old is focused on using the event to commemorate the wonderful Hunt family. He and the Lockhart community want people everywhere to learn about what Kim achieved as a nurse, a brain injury sufferer, and as a friend. 

Stojanovic also hopes the ride will send a message of hope to other people with brain injuries, as evidence of what they are capable of achieving. 

The pair, both residents of a small town in the NSW Riverina named Lockhart, formed a close bond as they both fought to recover from their brain trauma. 

> “Both accidents were really similar, just weeks and kilometres apart from each other,” said Jackson Strong, Luke’s lifelong best friend and a renowned motocross star.

The road ride has long been a dream for the 22-year-old, and he had often discussed his plans with Ms. Hunt. She had promised to ride part of the way with Luke to support him.

![A poster promoting one half of the fundraising campaign, made by Kim Hunt's sister Jenny Blake.](image_url)  
The Lockhart community will come together for a charity ride on March 7 to raise funds for brain injury sufferers and to remember the beloved Hunt family.

On June 20, 2012, Stojanovic, then a 20-year-old up-and-coming motocross rider, missed a seat grab and landed on his head whilst training for motocross stunt riding. Shortly afterwards, on July 14, Ms. Hunt suffered life-threatening injuries when she flipped her car twice while on the road leading to her Lockhart home. Her then-four-year-old daughter Phoebe was also in the vehicle and suffered minor injuries. 

The two Lockhart residents met and formed a tight bond at the very beginning of their long road to recovery. 

> “Luke and the Hunt family made a connection in hospital, and that never ended. Whenever Luke came to Lockhart, Kim and the Hunt family would always make sure they all came up to spend time with him,” Mr. Strong told Daily Mail Australia.

Mr. Stojanovic is motivated to raise money to improve the resources at the two hospitals to help provide care for other people who are suffering. 

> “Throughout my days in Liverpool Hospital, I was able to meet others of all ages with different degrees of brain injuries, who were fighting their own battles and who in return were inspirational people to me,” said Mr. Stojanovic. “After spending so much time in the Rehab Unit, I realised that these people, and the Brain Injury Unit overall, would benefit from new equipment and a total makeover.”

Kim and Luke gave each other a lot of strength and lifted each other with their friendship. Mr. Stojanovic has made incredible progress thanks to his determined efforts to recover from his injury. He is pictured with his friends shortly after the accident in June 2012.

Mandy and Jackson Strong are organising the Lockhart bike ride and say the community will do anything to keep the memory of the Hunt family alive. 

> “They went through the same hospital circuits, and the families became quite close. They maintained a connection,” agreed Mr. Strong. “Going through the same thing with a brain injury, it was so good for them to be able to talk with each other. Kim recovered more quickly than Luke, so she was also inspirational for him, motivating him by showing him what he is capable of achieving.”

The bike ride is an important step for Luke and the rest of the community who mourn the deaths of the treasured Hunt family. 

> “When the tragedy happened, it hit Luke pretty hard, and he wants to do everything he can to keep their memory alive,” said Mr. Strong. “I think everyone in the community feels the same and they will do whatever they can. The whole ride is about what an amazing person Kim was, the recovery she had, and keeping awareness alive for people in the same situation. Kim and Luke’s lives show people that they can make something positive out of it.”

Before Stojanovic embarks on his ride, the Lockhart community will come together and hold **‘The Kim Hunt and Family Memorial Ride’** to raise funds for two intensive care units and show their support. 

Stojanovic has worked tirelessly to recover from his brain injury, spending hours a day on the bike at the gym at his rehab centre. 

> “Luke rides a specially remodelled bike. He does a lot of training and goes for rides. He does up to **60 kilometres** a day, depending on his fitness.” 

> “I’ll be riding next to him but probably only be able to go half as far as Luke will. He’s pretty fit!” said Mr. Strong.

Before Stojanovic embarks on his ride, the Lockhart community will come together and hold **‘The Kim Hunt and Family Memorial Ride’** to raise funds for two intensive care units and show their support. 

Members of the community will ride **93 kilometres** from Wagga to Lockhart on March 7. 

> “I am extremely lucky to have the love and support of all my family, friends, and our local community,” said Mr. Stojanovic. “Also for dedicated nurses, doctors, rehab physiotherapists, and everyone who is helping me with my recovery.”

Kim and Luke formed a close friendship during their recovery. Whenever Luke came home to Lockhart, Kim, her husband Geoff, and their three young children (L to R) Phoebe, Fletcher, and Mia would always visit. 

People are encouraged to take part in the day in whatever way they can, whether it be riding part of the way by joining in at Mangoplan and The Rock, or joining in for a barbecue at Lockhart Swimming Pool. 

Mrs. Strong is campaigning for people to donate online to help raise funds for the intensive care units that made such a difference to Mr. Stojanovic and Mrs. Hunt’s lives. It is also fitting as Mrs. Hunt had been a dedicated and caring nurse who spent so much time helping those in need at both Wagga Wagga Base Hospital and Lockhart District Hospital. 

> “I am extremely lucky to have the love and support of all my family, friends, and our local community. Also, for the dedicated nurses, doctors, rehab physiotherapists, and everyone who is helping me with my recovery,” said Mr. Stojanovic.

The response from the community has been astounding according to Mrs. Strong.

As Arsenal travelled to Istanbul for the first leg of their play-off against Besiktas, both teams had chances in an open game, while Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain hit the post late on. The visitors were playing the latter period of the game with ten men after Aaron Ramsey was sent off for two petulant yellow cards.

**Besiktas:** TBA  
**Arsenal:** TBA  
**Host commentator**

Final whistle goes, sorry about the lack of goals... Arsenal probably had the best of the chances tonight, hitting the post late on, but after Aaron Ramsey's sending off will have to take a draw away from home. They'll be back at the Emirates next week, and will be eager to make the group stage.

**90mins:** Late sub for Arsenal, who will be happy with this scoreline now, despite that near miss. Credit to Mathieu Debuchy, who has been brilliant going forward, and in defence on the right.

**88mins:** That was absolutely brilliant from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. Dribbling in from the right-hand side, the midfielder unleashes a shot on his weaker foot which the goalkeeper does well to tip onto the post.

**83mins:** Arsenal understandably sitting back now, it’s Besiktas' time to attack. Kerim Frei, formerly of Fulham, is on for Ozyakup who seemed to be losing his temper.

**80mins:** Well this makes things interesting... Aaron Ramsey picked up a cheap first yellow for tugging back his opponent, and he makes the same mistake. Tugs back Ozyakup after losing possession, and now the visitors have a real challenge on their hands.

**72mins:** Second sub for Arsenal, as the hugely promising Alexis Sanchez goes off. Like for like swap with the Ox coming on.

**68mins:** Finally Arsenal burst into life into the second half. Great passing down the right between Sanchez and Debuchy, and the right-back's pull-back finds Giroud... but his shot is blocked. Approaching the 70th minute, Wenger has the likes of Rosicky, Oxlade-Chamberlain, and Joel Campbell available should he wish to change things up.

**66mins:** Monreal joins Ramsey and Flamini in the book for Arsenal as he catches Mustafa late as the midfielder tried to play Demba Ba through.

**59mins:** Neither team committing too much at the moment. Few shots from long range here and there, but little else. You would think Besiktas would have to come out and attack, being the home team.

**55mins:** It's almost like his job is collecting yellows. Mathieu Flamini goes into the book, a flurry of sorts at the moment.

**53mins:** Lots of challenges going in so I'm surprised that's the first booking of the game. Motta cynically takes out Alexis Sanchez on the halfway line as the Chilean broke past him. Minutes later Aaron Ramsey pulls back Ozyakup and earns himself a cheap yellow.

**50mins:** Worry for Arsenal with Everton up next, skipper Mikel Arteta hobbles off with a knock. Flamini replaces him, while Koscielny takes the captain's armband. Arsenal made it into half-time for refuge but the second-half has exactly the same feel. Besiktas quicker and sharper to the ball, more aggressive. Arsenal would probably take the 0-0 if it were on offer at the moment.

**47mins:** Arsenal carved open. Olcay is played in down the left with so much space to run into - he cuts inside, opens up the shot into the far corner, but Szczesny will be relieved to see that one curl just wide. Away we go again. No shot from kick-off this time. So much for entertainment, Arsenal...

Well that was different, eh? The Champions League is back, and it was so nearly back with a bang with Demba Ba's five-second shot off the bar from kick-off. It's been end-to-end in Istanbul, but both teams can't quite execute their final ball. Alexis Sanchez has looked lively for the visitors, while Olivier Giroud should really have opened the scoring.

**45mins:** Oh dear. It hasn't been Olivier's half. A beautiful chipped ball finds the Frenchman but he misses his left-footed volley completely.

**44mins:** Rare lack of composure from Calum Chambers. The youngster attempts a crossfield pass to his centre-back partner, but it's intercepted by Ba. The striker twists and turns and his shot wrong-foots Szczesny, but it's just wide. Athletic Bilbao have just taken a surprise lead away at Napoli, Iker Muniain with that goal. Seems to be a thriller in Copenhagen too, with Bayer Leverkusen leading 3-2.

**38mins:** Great effort from Jack Wilshere. The midfielder plays a one-two with Giroud, and after looking up to see no one in front of him, curls towards goal from 25 yards. The keeper does well to dive and save and hold. That was heading towards the top corner.

**30mins:** Slight appeal for a penalty there for Besiktas. Chambers tracks Veli and doesn't get the ball, but the player wasn't going for it himself. Right decision from the referee. Chambers is so full of composure for Arsenal at the back. This is his first Champions League game and he is clearly enjoying himself out there. Everything about him is measured and controlled.

**25mins:** Plenty of whistles as Arsenal try and build attacks. Giroud, who has been somewhat sluggish so far, nearly picks out Alexis Sanchez with a dinked cross. Arsenal in the ascendancy as the hosts sit back.

**18mins:** This game settling down after a fast and frenetic start. Alexis Sanchez really does look in the mood, while Calum Chambers has started well at the back for Arsenal. Seems they just have to be patient.

**13mins:** But this is much better from Arsenal now. Sanchez again involved, his cut back finds Santi Cazorla, whose shot zips past the post from a tight angle. Arsenal have a holding midfielder on the bench in Mathieu Flamini and it looks like they could do with him in the early part of this game. Arsenal’s midfield being over-run in the opening spell.

**12mins:** Seems to be so much space for Arsenal on the right. This time Aaron Ramsey tries to break clear but the referee doesn't play advantage after a trip on Sanchez.

**10mins:** Great ball from Ozyakup over the top of Calum Chambers to find Ba. The Senegalese striker connects well with his left foot on the volley, but the goalkeeper does well to palm it away. Looking really dangerous here, the hosts. But here's Arsenal on the break! Sanchez bursts clear but his cross is deflected and Giroud can't quite get it out of his feet.

**5mins:** All over the place at the minute Arsenal. The hosts are playing nice quick football on this 'questionable' surface. Arsene Wenger's side struggling to get going. 

Away we go! And off the bar immediately! A shot straight from kick-off troubles Wojciech Szczesny. What a start... Demba Ba with the effort. And the atmosphere is incredible in Istanbul. Arsenal will surely be happy enough with a draw here. Can they start on the front foot? 

Speaking to ITV before the game: 'It's windy and the pitch is not the best at all, we will have to adapt.' Arsenal fans will hope they do that quickly... Worryingly also, he says Koscielny declared himself fit: 'Koscielny has inflammation but he has declared himself fit, you have to trust the player.'

We know what Arsenal can bring, but what about Besiktas? One player to look out for is Oğuzhan Özyakup who is a former youth product in North London. Wenger said: 'I always thought he could make a career but at our club he had big competition in front of him and that is why we let him go. It is good to see he has made it to the top level and is now an important player in Turkey.'

Arsenal have won all 12 of their previous Champions League play-off matches. That's some record. They have also scored eight goals in their last two games in Istanbul, against Fenerbahce and Galatasaray. It may be tough tonight though at the Olympic Stadium. Perhaps they should ask Liverpool for some advice...

Demba Ba has spoken this week about how Jose Mourinho stopped his move to Arsenal last summer, and he now believes he didn't play for Chelsea as he wasn't a star name. ‘Sometimes when you are at a club with a lot of big stars, the name counts for more than the statistics. Unfortunately, it was like that in my case,’ he said. Time to prove your point!

As expected Demba Ba starts for the hosts, looking to build on his two goals in five games against the Gunners. For Arsenal, Olivier Giroud comes in for the injured Yaya Sanogo, and similarly Nacho Monreal replaces Kieran Gibbs. Alexis Sanchez will be looking to score his first goal for the club, and don't forget about Aaron Ramsey...

**Szczesny; Debuchy, Koscielny, Chambers, Monreal; Arteta, Ramsey; Cazorla, Wilshere, Sanchez; Giroud.**  
**Subs:** Martinez, Bellerin, Miquel, Flamini, Rosicky, Oxlade-Chamberlain & J.Campbell.  

**Tolga, İsmail, Motta, Ersan, Pedro, Olcay, Veli, Necip, Oğuzhan, Mustafa, Demba Ba.**

Concrete information should arrive shortly, but we can gather certain aspects about Arsenal's line-up. Calum Chambers is expected to make his Champions League debut

 after impressing in recent weeks, while it will be interesting to see whether Alexis Sanchez starts. The Chilean struggled somewhat in the 2-1 victory against Crystal Palace at the weekend, and could be rested for this weekend's trip to Everton.

Hit them where it hurts! Lukas Podolski may not be here (though there is still Wojciech Szczesny), but Besiktas manager Slavan Bilic says his side will be battling on the pitch... not taking pictures. 'We are not here to take selfies with Arsenal on the pitch, we are here to battle to the end,' Bilic said at his pre-match press conference.

Hello and welcome to Sportsmail's coverage as Arsenal travel to Istanbul to play Besiktas tonight.

52c996b506bb61638aa4821b63dc438dbacf0f11,"The deadly fire at a Annapolis mansion that killed a couple and their four grandchildren was caused by a 15-foot dry Christmas tree, investigators revealed today.

An electrical failure in the mansion's ""Great Room"" which was connected to the sleeping and living areas sparked the January 19 blaze which was fueled by the tree. Technology executive Don Pyle, his wife, Sandra, and their four grandchildren were killed after the fire swept through their $9 million 16,000-square-foot mansion.

Anne Arundel County Fire officials said the Christmas tree had been cut down more than 60 days before the fire and investigators said they believe the Pyles lit their tree ""most of the time"". They had gathered around the tree on Christmas Day. Investigators would not reveal where the bodies were found out of respect for the family, but they said they were sleeping when the fire started. They also did not confirm if they died from smoke inhalation.

Sisters Alexis 'Lexi' Boone, 8 (left), and Kaitlyn 'Katie' Boone, 7 (right), died in the fire.

Tragic victims: Siblings Charlotte Boone, 8 (left), and Wesley Boone, 6, (right) also died on January 19.

Family night: Grandparents Don and Sandy Pyle had their four grandchildren over for a sleepover.

On Monday fire crews recovered the sixth and final body from the charred remains of the mansion, a week after it was destroyed by a devastating fire. They said smoke detectors in the house were working, but added sprinklers would have helped ""without a doubt"" but the home did not have them because it was built in 2005, four years before Anne Arundel began to require them in new residential homes.

ATF agent Bill McMullan said the fire was ""a tragic accident that occurred at the worst possible time"".

The family issued a statement to the media on the cause of the fire late on Tuesday evening.

""While the explanation that has been shared with us today does not bring solace, it does start us down the long road to acceptance,"" said the statement. ""We continue to express our sincere gratitude to the Anne Arundel County Fire Department, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, the Anne Arundel County Crisis Response System, and all other assisting departments.""

""It is our hope that each of you are strengthened in your resolve to cherish your family, friends, and loved ones. Make time today to hug them, tell them how much they mean to you, and let them know how much you love them,"" the statement continued.

Mansion fire: The $9 million home in Annapolis, Maryland, caught fire around 3:30 am on January 19.

The Boone and Pyle family released a joint statement saying:

""We are relieved that our loved ones have all been recovered. We are grateful for the outpouring of love and support from our community, friends, and neighbors.""

Eve Morrison, the wife of Clint Boone, and the mother of Charlotte and Wesley, posted a message to Facebook about the tragedy Thursday.

The message read: ""Clint and I would like to thank everyone again for all of your messages and support. It means so much to us all at this time. I am trying to read all the messages and thank you so much for reaching out to us.""

Although way too short, our babies' lives were incredibly happy and they were loved by so many. Thank you everyone so very much. Love to all. XOXO

According to The Baltimore Sun, Randy and Stacey Boone, parents of Lexi and Katie, have a three-week-old son who was not at the Pyles' home on the night of the tragedy.

An earlier family statement given to WUSA9 read:

""On behalf of the Boone and Pyle families, we wish to express our gratitude and appreciation for the love and support being shared with us during this tragic event. We are blessed that so many family, friends, and neighbors have come together for us in our time of need.""

""Our love for our family is boundless. Our loss demands time and quiet reflection to process these feelings. We ask that you respect our need for privacy,"" the statement continued.

""Life is fragile. Make time today to embrace your loved ones.""

Tech tycoon Don Pyle, 56, lived in the sprawling 16,000-square-foot waterfront home with his wife, Sandra.

Stacey Boone, mother to Lexi and Katie with Sandra Pyle's son Randy Boone, wrote on Facebook last Tuesday: ""I never knew that I could hurt this badly. It's unreal. All one big nightmare that I can't wake up from.""","Technology executive Don Pyle, his wife, Sandra, and four grandchildren died on January 19 .

Flares have also been set off and glass bottles thrown in the main square ahead of Everton's clash with the French side in the Europa League on Thursday evening. An Everton fan was even hit in the head by a tear gas canister, according to reports.

It was like scene from Green Street. Flares were set off in Lille's main square as Everton fans gathered ahead of Thursday's Europa League game. Riot police advanced on Lille's main square as Everton fans reportedly sang an ode to Seamus Coleman. Unconfirmed reports indicate that tear gas was used by police on Everton fans in Lille's main square. 

Thousands of people gathered in Lille's main square on Thursday as they prepared for the Europa League. The main square in Lille was largely cleared by riot police following the incidents on Thursday afternoon. The fans were gathered and talking before flares were set off and chanting ensured in the square. Everton's official Twitter account sent out a message warning fans not to go near Lille's main square. 

Unconfirmed reports indicate that French police used tear gas and fired rubber bullets on Everton fans. Everton fans sang loudly in the squad and showed support for their side ahead of the Europa League clash.

'The club has been made aware of an isolated incident in a bar in Lille on Wednesday evening in which a number of Evertonians were attacked by a group of around 50 local men. The club understands that two Everton fans suffered minor facial injuries and were taken to the local hospital and that this was the only incident in what was otherwise a good-natured evening in the city centre. The club are in continual contact with Merseyside police officers who are in Lille today (Thursday) and the city's police representatives. Supporters travelling to tonight's match are advised to utilise the travel information provided on the official website where updates on any safety matters will also be provided.'

Fans rushed from the square rubbing their eyes after large explosions were set off and tear gas thrown, onlookers claim. One fan even alleged the trouble started when Everton fans were singing an ode to right back Seamus Coleman - only for riot police to storm into the main square. The Toffees' official Twitter account also sent out a message saying: 'We advise Everton fans in Lille to avoid the main square in the city centre.' 

Official confirmation is being sought on the alleged actions of the police. This occurred after a group of Everton fans were attacked in a seemingly unprovoked attack in Lille city centre late on Wednesday night. Up to 100 hooded Lille supporters ambushed English fans drinking outside the city's Australian bar close to 10pm local time after a peaceful day in the northern French city in which supporters of both clubs seemed to be getting along. 

Police arrived on the scene within minutes to disperse the trouble with gas but eyewitnesses reported a number of injuries, with some Everton fans suffering bloodied head wounds. Early reports say the attack started when a group of visiting fans were smoking outside the bar and were attacked by an apparently well-organised group of French hooligans. 

A doorman at the bar told the Liverpool Echo: 'The atmosphere was nice all day. The Everton fans were singing, showing us their flags and having fun. All very respectful. In the evening they watched the Liverpool game and towards the end of that match it happened. It was bad. The Lille hooligans just appeared from the Place Louise de Bettignies across the road, from a side street, and just ran at the pub. There were some Everton fans outside smoking and they got caught cold. 

'The hooligans picked up chairs we had stacked up outside and attacked them while others used them to smash windows and try to get inside. We had to try and stop the Everton supporters inside from getting out to help because it would have got far worse. I went out to try and drag them in. Everton boss Roberto Martinez spoke to the media ahead of his side's third Europa League group game. Toffees keeper Tim Howard gestures during his side's training session at Lille's stadium on Wednesday. 

'I saw one older English guy being punched by about three Lille hooligans. His face was bleeding badly. I am so sorry for what happened.' Windows were smashed, forcing the bar to be closed early as police waded in to quell the trouble, although some Everton fans complained of heavy-handed treatment. 

TV commentator Sam Matterface, who will be covering the game for ITV4 on Thursday alongside pundit Clarke Carlisle, said: 'Not a great night in the Australian Bar in Lille. EFC (Everton) fans claiming they were attacked. We walked into it late - blue lights, police, gas.' 

The sudden burst of violence was in contrast to a pleasant day in Lille when the first of several thousand Everton fans expected for the match arrived by plane or at the Eurostar train terminal. There may be up to 7,000 fans from Merseyside in town by kick-off, and police are certain to up their presence and may seek to impose an alcohol ban around the stadium.","Flares set off in Lille's main square on Thursday as Everton fans gather .

## A Troubling Tale from Within the Saudi Royal Court

When Cay Garcia, a fifty-something from Cape Town, was offered a well-paid job working for a princess from Saudi Arabia's ruling dynasty, she jumped at the chance. But less than four months after she arrived in the Saudi capital Riyadh, she was hustled onto a plane and thrown out of the country - all because she stood up to her abusive employer.

Now back in South Africa, she has written a book laying bare her experiences at the hands of the Saudi royals - and sheds light on a side of Riyadh life that is rarely seen by outsiders.

### A Harsh Reality

Poorly treated: Cay saw the princess' Filipino servants being cruelly treated and subjected to vicious beatings.
In charge: King Abdullah is the current ruler of Saudi Arabia and ascended to the Saudi throne in 2005.

'Life in Riyadh for a woman is harsh,' she explains. 'A single woman cannot even go for a coffee on her own - it's deemed immoral.'

You are allowed to walk around a mall but walking around one's neighbourhood for exercise is heavily frowned upon.

### A Palace of Horrors

Difficult though living up to Saudi Arabia's strict moral code proved - a code enforced by religious police known as the Mutawa - her difficulties were nothing compared to what she would experience within the palace itself.

There, as the head of a team of five staff members including two Malawians and two Filipinos, she was forced to watch as the princess, who Cay has decided not to identify, doled out harsh punishments that included beatings and having their rooms turned upside down, in addition to dealing with the capricious moods of the princess herself.

'In the beginning the princess seemed to be on her best behaviour although the abuse started soon after.'

### The Abuse Continues

Eventually, and after several more confrontations, Cay's contract was terminated by mutual agreement and she was given an exit visa - a courtesy still yet to be extended to the other domestic staff in the princess' employ.

Both relieved and upset, she had less than 24 hours to pack her things and say goodbye to the friends she had made among the expat community.

Harder still was saying goodbye to the colony of stray cats she had befriended, in particular because she had had no time to make arrangements for them.

'I hated the total lack of empathy when it comes to animals,' she adds. 'I am a passionate animal lover and found it really traumatising to see the thousands of stray, starving cats that gather around the dustbins in Riyadh.'

### A Memoir of Survival

Memoir: Cay has written a book about her experiences called Behind Palace Walls.

'From what the princess told me, there were many incidents, perceived or real, where she was hurt in her life.'

The princess also suffers from depression and is bi-polar, neither of which help matters, but, although it wasn't often seen, she has a nurturing side.

She loves children as well and I think that part of the reason for her behaviour might be frustration at not being married and having babies of her own.'

### Conclusion

Even, it seems, if she didn't appreciate all of them. Cay's memoir, Behind Palace Walls: Life in the Service of a Saudi Princess, is published by Tafelberg Publishers Ltd and costs £10.95.","Cay Garcia, from Cape Town, worked as a butler for a Saudi princess .
Was disgusted by extent of the abuse, mostly directed at Filipino maids .
Eventually left after confronting her employer about treatment of staff .
Incidents included beatings and rooms being trashed as punishment .
Also saw one maid being forced to tip a bucket of ice over her own head .
Expats cannot leave without being given an exit visa by their employer .
As a result, maids with whom Cay worked are trapped in Riyadh .
Cay has chosen not to give the name of her blue-blooded employer .","Cay Garcia, a South African woman, recounts her harrowing experiences working for a princess from Saudi Arabia's ruling dynasty. Despite being well-paid, Cay was subjected to verbal abuse, harassment, and beatings by her employer, who would often lash out at her staff members, particularly two Filipino maids who were forced to stay in the country after their contracts ended. The princess' behavior escalated over time, with Cay witnessing incidents such as forcing one maid to stand outside her room dripping wet for hours. After several confrontations and a contract termination by mutual agreement, Cay was finally allowed to leave the country. Her memoir, ""Behind Palace Walls,"" sheds light on the restrictive and abusive side of life in Riyadh, where women are forbidden from driving and have limited freedoms."

Will Kevans, a 51-year-old Falklands veteran, was surprised when he met Prince Harry at an exhibition where he showcased his artwork. The royal, who has an A Level in art, revealed that he ""loves"" comics and would choose them over books.

**Prince Harry's Admission**

During the conversation with Mr Kevans, a cartoonist and former Welsh Guardsman, Prince Harry said: 'I don't read many books but I love comics.' The confession comes amid speculation that Harry might return to flying Apaches after he finishes his current posting in a desk job.

**Will Kevans' Artistic Talents**

Mr Kevans had been attending an exhibition which coincided with the ceremony at Westminster Abbey. He showcased his drawings, including a scaled down version of a First World War scene. The Falklands veteran also revealed that he preferred comics to books and was passionate about drawing cartoons.

**The Graphic Novel**

Will Kevans created a graphic novel titled 'My Life In Pieces: The Falklands War', which took him two and a half years to complete. The book tells the story of a group of Welsh Guards 'thrown into the unknown and the untold tales from Two Company’s advance on the mainland towards Port Stanley'. Mr Kevans hopes that the book will help other veterans to overcome psychological trauma.

**Meeting Prince Harry**

The artist was surprised to see Prince Harry at the exhibition, but pleased he connected with his work. The prince viewed Will Kevans' book and was impressed by his drawings. Mr Kevans even offered Prince Harry a discount on one of his artwork pieces.

**Prince Harry's Interest in Comics**

It seems that Prince Harry has an interest in comics, which caught the attention of Will Kevans. The Falklands veteran revealed that creating the graphic novel was an emotional experience, especially after he contacted fellow veterans he hadn't spoken with for over 30 years.

**The Book's Purpose**

Will Kevans hopes that his book will help other veterans to overcome psychological trauma. A percentage of the book sales are being donated to Combat Stress and SAMA Wales (South Atlantic Medal Association, Welsh Branch).

**Prince Harry's Recent Activities**

Recently, Prince Harry has been speaking to veterans at various events over the last week. He told Flight Sergeant Lee Renard that he 'enjoyed flying and missed it', but royal sources have suggested that it is unlikely for him to return to flying Apaches.

He accused David Cameron of planning to inflict ‘big cuts in spending’ which would ‘short change our children’s future’ if he is elected for a second term.

Labour leader Ed Miliband promised to create thousands of new school places in England to cap class sizes for five, six and seven-year-olds.

**Blair's Pledge: A Reminder**

But the Labour leader’s promises were already unravelling last night as the Institute for Fiscal Studies think-tank suggested that the Labour and Tory plans came to virtually the same amount of money, with the Conservatives potentially spending even more.

Mr Miliband announced he would put £180million a year into capping class sizes at 30 pupils for five to seven-year-olds. Mr Blair, in his five-point pledge card for the 1997 election, had promised to cap class sizes at 30, and laws to ban classes bigger than this were enacted in 2001.

**Class Sizes: A History**

But by 2006 it emerged that nearly 30,000 pupils in 910 infant classes were being taught in groups larger than the legal limit, although Labour claimed at the time that the number of pupils taught in oversized groups had fallen by 477,000 between 1997 and 2006.

Mr Miliband has blamed the Coalition for allowing the number of young primary school pupils in classes of more than 30 to treble from 31,265 to 93,345 in four years. Exceptions are only meant to be permitted in special circumstances such as to allow twins to be in the same class, or Armed Forces children to get a place at their local school.

**Labour's Plan: Delivering on Class Size Cap**

Mr Miliband said that to take account of these exceptions, Labour would ban class sizes of more than 30 for any longer than 12 months. He said the 30-pupil cap would be delivered by halting the creation of new free schools in areas where there are already state schools for children to attend.

**Education: A Passport to Success**

The Labour leader, speaking at Haverstock School in North London, said education ‘is the passport to success in life’, adding: ‘The next Labour government will protect the overall education budget. Rising budgets, protected in real terms, every year.’

**Labour's Education Plan**

The move is part of Labour's plan for education in England, including the appointment of new local 'directors of standards' to drive up schools' performance.

Mr Miliband set out his education plans in a speech at his old school, Haverstock School, in north London. He won praise from teachers’ unions, but the Conservatives claimed that their spending plans, outlined by Mr Cameron last week, would actually involve spending more over the next five years.

**Conservative Spending Plans**

The Prime Minister said he would keep the amount of funding per pupil – around £4,200 a year in primary school and £5,300 for secondary pupils – the same for the period. This amounts to a real-terms cut per pupil, because it takes no account of rising inflation.

**IFS on Labour and Tory Plans**

But the schools budget will go up because the number of schoolchildren aged between five and 15 will rise by 7 per cent in the next five years. The Conservatives say this means they will spend £204.62billion on schools in the next Parliament, while Labour would spend slightly less at £204.03billion.

A spokesman for the Institute for Fiscal Studies said the policies ‘present different risks. If inflation is higher than expected then a cash freeze per pupil could be less generous. If the number of pupils increases by much more than expected, then it would be the other way around’.

The IFS said the Tories have only promised to protect schools at age five to 16, not early years or sixth form, giving Labour flexibility to spend more in these areas.","Ed Miliband leader uses speech at his old school in Camden to echo Tony Blair’s landmark 1997 election pledge .

 Toronto's City Council today voted overwhelmingly to strip crack-smoking Mayor Rob Ford of some of his powers in the latest attempt to box in the brash leader who has refused to resign.

The motion, approved in a 39-3 vote, suspends Ford's authority to appoint and dismiss the deputy mayor and his executive committee, so Ford is unable to fire members who speak out against him.

An unusually subdued Ford vowed to fight the motion in court. 'I can't support this and obviously I have no other options but to challenge this in court,' the mayor said.

**Battle: Toronto Mayor Rob Ford**

Toronto Mayor Rob Ford stands in the council chamber in Toronto on Friday as the City Council voted overwhelming to strip him of some of his powers following his crack-smoking scandal.

A few members had expressed concerns about the move to reduce his powers, even though they said they disapproved of the mayor's conduct. 'We are collectively disgusted with the mayor's behavior,' Councilor Anthony Perruzza said. 'If one day we are disgusted with someone’s political views or their political positions, basically we can do the same thing?'

**Stubborn: Ford Refuses to Step Aside**

Ford, who has refused to step aside despite the revelations, smiles during the meeting Friday.

Vote: Councillor John Filion, pictured on Friday, said reducing Ford's powers to appoint and dismiss the deputy mayor and his executive committee, means Ford is unable to fire those who criticize him.

**Latest Antics from Ford**

In the span of a few hours on Thursday, Ford used obscene language to deny that he pressured a female employee for oral sex, admitted that he had driven while drinking and then apologized for his vulgarity and said he was seeking professional help, though he refused to give details.

Allegations that he made sexual advances towards staffer Olivia Gondek had sparked an angry outburst earlier in the day. 'It says that I wanted to eat her . p****,' he told reporters. 'I would never do that. I'm happily married. I've got more than enough to eat at home, thank you very much.'

**Beleaguered: Ford Faces More Allegations**

At noon, the mayor held yet another press conference backed by his wife Renata to apologize for his 'graphic language' blaming the 'impulse in my remarks' on the last six months of 'tremendous stress'.

'The revelations yesterday of cocaine, escorts and prostitution have pushed me over the line,' he said. 'I used unforgivable language.'

Standing by her man: Renata Ford does not look impressed as her husband gives at the press conference.

He also upset the Toronto Argonauts by wearing the football team's jersey at City Hall on Thursday when he made vulgar statements and admitted to driving while drunk.

Councilor Denzil Minnan-Wong, a former ally, said: 'We need to take away his power for the good of the city. The tide has turned and there are very few people that are prepared to defend him given his vulgar comments and his admission that not only does he takes drugs but that he seems to be comfortable drinking and getting behind the wheel.'

**Ford's Troubles Escalate**

Ford's troubles began escalating in 2008, when a domestic dispute started between the two when Ford called the police because of his wife's 'irrational, out-of-control' behavior. When police 'saw the situation' they informed him to leave with the children so he took them to his mother's house.

The next day, Ford returned to his house to take a shower and change clothes and that's when Renata called police. Ford was arrested and charged with assaulting his wife and threatening to kill her. The charges were eventually dropped due to 'credibility issues' on Renata's part and the couple seemed to patch things up after the incident.

'Everything's going great...whatever it takes,' Ford said when he finally returned to his home. 'I support my wife. My wife supports me.'

Speaking on NBC News' 'Meet The Press', Kaci Hickox, who tested negative for the deadly virus earlier this week, condemned New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's policy toward such workers.

**'When Christie stated it was an abundance of caution, which is his reasoning for putting health care workers in a sort of quarantine for three weeks, it was really an abundance of politics,' she said.**

The 33-year-old, who lives in Fort Kent with her boyfriend, Ted Wilbur, added:

**'And I think all of the scientific and medical and public health community agrees with me on that statement.'**

Fighting for change: Kaci Hickox (pictured), who successfully fought Maine's quarantine for health care workers who have treated Ebola patients,  today said the guidelines were driven by an 'abundance of politics'

**We know a lot about Ebola. We know that it's not transmitted from someone who is asymptomatic, as I am and many other aid workers will be when they return.'**

However, in a separate interview, Miss Hickox said she will respect the wishes of Fort Kent's 4,000 residents and refrain from venturing out until November 10.

**'I didn't mean to bring this media storm onto this community, either, but I think unfortunately sometimes, especially when up against governors, you don't always have an option,' she said.**

Hickox originally worked in Indonesia, Burma, the Darfur region of Sudan, and Nigeria before returning to the U.S. to earn masters' degrees in public health and nursing.

**She went to Sierra Leone this summer with Doctors Without Borders when the Ebola outbreak erupted.**

On her last night in the country, she treated a little girl who didn't survive:

**'I don't remember her exact age. I think she was 10, but to watch a 10-year-old die alone, in a tent and know there wasn't anything you could do, it's hard,' she said.**

President Barack Obama, the nation's top infectious-disease expert, and humanitarian groups have warned that overly restrictive measures could cripple the fight against Ebola at its source.

**Warning: President Barack Obama (pictured), the nation's top infectious-disease expert and humanitarian groups have warned that overly restrictive measures could cripple the fight against the disease at its source.**

They claim such measures could discourage volunteers like Miss Hickox from going to West Africa, where the outbreak has sickened more than 13,000 people and killed nearly 5,000 of them.

**'These kinds of restrictions could dissuade hundreds, if not thousands, of skilled volunteers from helping stop Ebola's spread, which is in the national interest of every one of our countries,' Samantha Power, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said Thursday in Brussels.**

U.S. public concern about Ebola is high, even though only one person in the country is currently being treated for it, a New York doctor, Craig Spencer, who cared for patients in West Africa.

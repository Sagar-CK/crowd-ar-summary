Marouane Fellaini could feature off the bench against former employers . Steven Pienaar could make the Everton starting line-up after a month out . Seamus Coleman and James McCarthy face fitness tests at Old Trafford . Only four players have ever scored a hat-trick in the Barclays Premier League against Manchester United and two of them could play for Everton in this match: Samuel Eto’o and Romelu Lukaku. Manchester United have won just one of the last five Premier League games against Everton (W1 D1 L3). Alex Ferguson and David Moyes both lost their first Premier League home games as United boss against Everton. Everton have lost 299 Premier League games, which is more than any other team in the competition. Roberto Martinez’s side have dropped more points from winning positions than any other team in the Premier League (7). Robin van Persie is the second non-British player (after Dwight Yorke) to score 40+ Premier League goals for two different clubs . Everton have won five and lost just one of their last eight Premier League away matches. Manchester United have lost eight Premier League games at Old Trafford since the start of last season, as many as they had lost in the previous five campaigns from 2008-09 to 2012-13. Phil Jagielka could make his 250th Premier League appearance in this match. This could also be his 200th start for Everton in the competition. The Red Devils have already used 29 players in the Premier League this season; six more than any other team. They used 30 different players in the whole of 2013-14."

Ray Massey tested the new 5-door Ford Focus Zetec (pictured) this week and was impressed by the car's simple interior and streamlined exterior styling . GOOD . BAD . Golden Globewinning actor and car fan Idris Elba — star of the film Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom — has been putting Jaguar's new XE compact salon through its paces before it goes on sale in June priced from £26,995. Golden Globewinning actor and car fan Idris Elba (pictured) has been putting Jaguar's new XE compact salon through its paces before it goes on sale in June . As well as driving an XE from London to Berlin for a four-part documentary, he's taken part in a high-octane test at Spa, Belgium, with the help of ex-F1 driver Martin Brundle. He said: 'My work takes me around the world, but I rarely have the time to get behind the wheel myself.' Prime Minister David Cameron welcomed Rolls-Royce's official announcement that it's to build its first ever 4x4, creating hundreds of new jobs. He was present as the firm announced the multi-million pound investment at its Goodwood factory, in West Sussex, on Wednesday and hailed it as a huge vote of confidence in the UK and its economy. Rolls Royce officially announced this week that they will be building their first ever 4x4 and creating hundreds of new jobs - this photograph demonstrates how the new 4x4 could look . He said: 'The Government will do everything we can to support you because it is something the country needs more of.' The new super-luxury offroader (as imagined by Auto Express above) is set to go into production within three years, adding to a line-up which includes the Phantom and Ghost limousines and variants, plus the Wraith fastback. It will be a high-bodied allterrain vehicle with all-new aluminium architecture, which Rolls-Royce says is 'worthy of carrying the Spirit of Ecstasy into the future'.","The company have put a great deal of attention to detail into this model . The new Zetec is both effortless and nimble to drive . Ford have listened to their customers and simplified the car's interior . Were it not for a Press leak, this would be a test of the latest version of the Ford Fusion. That was the name planned for the mid-size hatchback, which in 1998 replaced the longrunning Escort. But Ford's then boss, the mercurial Jac Nasser, was so incensed that the cat had got out of the bag, he changed the name and revealed it just seconds before the curtains came up at its Geneva Motor Show launch. Now with 12 million sold worldwide, we're on the third generation. Ford does so many things without fuss that it's easy to take its cars for granted. A big mistake. The company puts a great deal of attention to detail into each model. So this newcomer is both effortless and nimble to drive, but also engaging, thanks to a crisp six-speed manual gearbox linked to a willing, yet frugal and award-winning, 1-litre 125bhp EcoBoost engine. The base price of the car I drove was £18,795, but it came with a few extras including Frozen White paint (£250), door edge protectors (£85), but most significantly the Ford Sync2 DAB navigation system (£500) with a big 8in touch-screen with on the central dashboard. It includes a splitscreen display, voice-control of audio, satnav, climate control and mobile phones, spoken street names, 3-D highway, junction and landmark views and even the Michelin guide. A chunk of money, but well worth it. The ergonomics make it easy to sit in and drive. Buttons tend to be where you want them. Ford said it's listened to customers who asked for simplicity inside the car with fewer controls and switches to navigate around. So a sensible de-clutter results in a cleaner, more modern feel to the interior with black satin trim and chrome detailing. Sufficient space in the back. The boot is big enough for the weekly shop. Good economy at around 60mpg — almost 50mpg in town, helped by stop-start technology. Acceleration from rest to 62 mph is 11 seconds which, while it won't break any speed records, is fine for family motoring. CO2 emissions are low at 108g/km. My Zetec trim level is the third of six which range from basic Studio to Style, Zetec, Zetec S, Titanium and Titanium X. Standard equipment includes 16 in alloy wheels, a quick-clear heated windscreen, air conditioning, remote central locking, hill-start assist, Thatcham category 1 alarm, halogen headlamps, sports-style front seats and a driver-seat lumbar adjust. Exterior styling has been refined to make it look more streamlined, but the main brief seems to have been, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Up against tough competition such as the Volkswagen Golf which, although more expensive, is a hard act to follow. There are some handy parking aids on offer, which use ultrasonic sensors to locate parking spaces and steer the car into them automatically. Sadly on the model I tested, they were not fitted. Having plumped for a midrange model, you might ask what else is on offer. Beyond the standard Titanium X trim there's the 135mph ST, with its 250 bhp 2-litre EcoBoost petrol engine, which hits showrooms this month from £22,195. There's also a 185 bhp diesel with a top speed of 135mph and 19in alloys, and a high-performance 320 bhp 2.3-litre allwheel drive RS — the 30th vehicle to wear the RS badge since 1968."
ab4f20267489cf2c48e461e4c7a65c873c2b69b9,"The Skoda Fabia has been named Car of the Year in the motor industry 'Oscars'. The Czech company, part of Germany's Volkswagen Group, took the top prize in the awards organised by What Car? magazine, beating more upmarket rivals, including BMWs, Range Rovers, Mercedes-Benz and Porsches. The awards ceremony, at the Grosvenor House Hotel, London, also saw the Fabia 1.2 TSI 90 SE, pictured right, named best small car, from a shortlist of 25. The honour repeats Skoda's feat of 15 years ago when its original Fabia won top prize. The Skoda Fabia (pictured) has been named Car of the Year in the motor industry 'Oscars' held at the Grosvenor House Hotel, London . Judges praised the Fabia's turbocharged 1.2-litre petrol engine for combining 'punchy and flexible performance with impressive efficiency credentials'. It's thrifty — averaging 58.8 mpg and has emissions of just 110g/km, putting it in the road tax bracket B, which costs nothing in the first year and £20 a year thereafter. The judges said: 'It also beats its main rivals in the small car class — the Ford Fiesta and Volkswagen Polo — for both space and practicality. 'The technology that comes as standard on the Fabia includes a brilliant 6.5in touch-screen and a system that can sync with Android phones to provide satnav. 'It's one of the very few cars on sale that has no major weaknesses and when you factor in how keenly priced it is, you start to wonder how on earth Skoda turns a profit. It might not be the most exciting car in the world, but it is the most sensible.' Prices from £10,600. What Car? editor Jim Holder said: 'We've evaluated all its rivals and the Fabia is the most rounded small car on sale in the UK today.' Since VW took over the firm, Skoda has shed its joke reputation to become a serious player in the car market. And it was a double triumph for Skoda's blend of Czech style and German engineering, as its larger Octavia 1.2 TSI 105 SE was named best family car. High-end 4x4 wars have broken out as arch rivals Rolls-Royce and Bentley - both celebrating record global sales and exports - gear up to launch ostentatious off-roaders. More than 4,000 Rolls-Royces were sold last year, and boss Torsten Mueller-Oetvoes told me this week the BMWowned firm would make its final decision on entering the market this year. It is also set to launch a drophead coupe based on the Wraith. Then Bentley boss Wolfgang Duerheimer said the company had taken 4,000 pre-orders for its off-roader. Production will help propel the Crewe factory from last year's record 11,000 cars to more than 20,000 by the end of the decade, keeping German owner Volkswagen happy. Expect also a smaller 'baby' Bentley coupe and soft-top to take on the likes of Aston Martin and Maserati. Bentley's Geordie MD Michael Straughan, who this week was hob-nobbing with Germany's Chancellor Merkel and Prime Minister David Cameron, has his work cut out. Watch out, too, for a much touted leap into the compact SUV market from Jaguar. Land Rover has announced a trio of limited editions of its classic Defender to mark the end of production in Britain. In December the last Defender will roll off the production lines at the firm's factory in Solihull. The Heritage edition, from £27,800, on sale from August, is inspired by the very first Land Rover and is a reinterpretation of the first pre-production Series 1 vehicle, nicknamed Huey, from 1947, taking its name from the registration plate HUE 166. Land Rover has announced a trio of limited editions of its classic Defender (pictured) to mark the end of production in Britain . The Adventure edition, pictured left, comes with expedition roof rack, snorkel and rear access ladder. Six hundred will be produced to go on sale from £43,495 in August. First out of the blocks in April will be 80 of the exclusive Autobiography range, from £61,845, for those who like to rough it in luxury. It has privacy glass, a full Windsor leather interior with ebony or ivory roof lining, and premium leather seats. To mark the launch, Land Rover also created the largest sand drawing ever in Britain — of the Defender — measuring 0.62 miles across. It was drawn by a fleet of six Land Rovers on the beach — Red Wharf Bay in Anglesey — where, in 1947, Rover's engineering director Maurice Wilks sketched out the shape of the original 4x4 to his brother Spencer, the firm's MD. However, Land Rover has reversed its original decision to kill off the much-loved classic Defender model. It will be built abroad, but outside the EU, possibly in India, South Africa or China.","The Czech company beat rivals BMW and Range Rover to win the title . The original Skoda Fabia won the award 15 years ago as well . Since VW took over the firm, Skoda has shed its joke reputation . Honda's yet-to-be-launched HR-V compact sports utility vehicle — which goes on sale in spring as a rival to the Nissan Juke — clinched the What Car? readers' award for the most eagerly anticipated launch of the year. Land Rover's new Discovery Sport, which I road-tested in Iceland recently, won the magazine's first safety award presented in conjunction with Thatcham Research, Britain's only Euro NCAP crash-test centre. And the larger and more luxuriously appointed Range Rover Sport SDV6 HSE was the best large sports utility vehicle. It was a triple triumph for Audi. Its sleek TT — from £29,777 to £40,270 — was named coupe of the year; its plug-in hybrid A3 Sportback e-tron, from £29,950, was judged top electric car; and the A3 Cabriolet, from £26,085, was named top convertible."
a859e48026a5a8971dcc4f7ea2fac137d19fc961,"The agency responsible for detaining and deporting illegal immigrants released more than 36,000 criminals living in the United States illegally last year, according to a new report. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency put rapists, murderers, kidnappers, dangerous drug dealers and other criminals who were in the process of being deported back on the streets the Center for Immigration Studies says. Many of the criminals had more than one conviction, CIS says, for a combined total of nearly 88,000 criminal convictions. U.S. Border Patrol and U.S. Air and Marine agents work together to detain illegal immigrant after chasing him down near the U.S.-Mexico border on April 11, 2013 near Mission, Texas . The Obama administration has earned a reputation for deporting more . illegal immigrants than its immediate predecessor. Since President Obama . took office close to two million illegal immigrants have been deported. Two-thirds of deportees have broken minor laws or no laws at, however, The New York Times reports. Only 20 percent illegal immigrants who are . deported commit violent crimes. 'We keep hearing from the administration that they are focused like a laser on enforcement against the worst of the worst, convicted criminals, as their top priority. On the other hand, they are releasing, at a rate of about 100 a day, aliens from their custody with criminal convictions, and many of them are serious criminal convictions,' CIS policy studies director Jessica M. Vaughan told the Washington Times. ICE arrested says it deported 216,810 criminal aliens in 2013 and arrested another 40,218. Based on CIS's report, ICE released the majority of the criminal aliens it arrested but did not deport. The Center for Immigration Studies report says ICE released 36,007 criminals who committed a combined total of 87,818 crimes in 2013. Of those, 17,228 convictions were for minor traffic violations and 15,635 came from DUIs. Other crimes were more serious, including . 9,187 dangerous drug convictions, 426 sexual assault convictions, 303 . kidnapping convictions, 193 homicide convictions, 1,317 domestic . violence convictions and 1,075 aggravated assault convictions. Some of these criminals were placed under supervision, others were not. CIS said it was unable to obtain the breakdown of how many illegal immigrants were unsupervised, supervised, placed on parole or received alternatives to detention such as tracking devices. ICE did not return the Washington Times' request for comment on the CIS report, but last year it blamed the looming sequester on a release of 622 immigrants. 'This is very hard for me to believe that they can’t find cuts . elsewhere in their agency,' House Speaker John Boehner said in response to ICE's actions. 'I frankly think this is outrageous.' House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte also criticized the decision. 'By releasing criminal immigrants onto the streets, the administration is needlessly endangering American lives,' he said at the time. The agency also said it had to let illegal immigrants go because did not have enough beds to hold all the people it was catching. Yet, two months ago ICE deputy director Daniel Ragsdale told a . House subcommittee that it would be requesting less money in 2015 for beds for detained illegal immigrants than it did the year before. The agency is reducing the number of beds at its facilities from 34,000 to 30,509 next year, he said. Ragsdale told members of the House Appropriations subcommittee on Homeland Security that the agency that it would focus 'costly detention capabilities on priority and mandatory detainees, while placing lower-risk, non-mandatory individuals in lower cost alternatives to detention programs.' 'ICE will work to realize continued efficiencies in detention operations to achieve this bed rate level,' he said. The Center for Immigration Studies questioned the timing of ICE's decision. 'The news that ICE . released so many criminal aliens convicted of so many serious and . violent crimes suggests that ICE could use more detention capacity, not . less, in order to prevent further harm to the public from these . individuals,' Vaughan writes in CIS' report. Public pressure over deportations seems to be at work, the report argues, noting that, 'A number of criminal aliens in detention while awaiting completion of . deportation proceedings have been the subject of petition campaigns, . prayer vigils, demonstrations, and other forms of protest against . enforcement.' 'Typically these protests occur on behalf of a criminal . alien who has family members in the United States. ICE should be asked . to disclose how many of these releases came after such appeals were made . on behalf of criminal aliens,' the report says.","A Center for Immigration Studies report . says ICE released 36,007 criminals who committed a combined total of . 87,818 crimes in 2013 .

6f0a317727a39be6c73a6d053be8cccd3bcfa510,"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . A review into how an IRA bomb suspect was wrongly told he was not wanted by police has found two other cases where similar errors were apparently made. Lady Justice Hallett found systematic flaws in the way so-called ‘comfort letters’ were sent to almost 200 republican suspected terrorists who were on-the-run. Critics today claimed it amounted to a ‘get out of jail free card’ for John Downey, who was accused of murdering four soldiers in the IRA's Hyde Park bombing in 1982. David Cameron ordered the review of the scheme after Downey’s trial collapsed after it emerged he had received a letter clearing him to travel to the UK. In May last year Mr Downey was arrested at Gatwick Airport and charged with killing Squadron Quartermaster Corporal Roy Bright, Lieutenant Anthony Daly, Trooper Simon Tipper and Lance Corporal Jeffrey Young. Seven horses were also killed in the attack as the soldiers travelled from their barracks to Buckingham Palace. But the existence of the letter telling him he was not wanted by police meant he walked free from court. The peace process plan agreed between Sinn Fein and Tony Blair's Labour government saw 190 letters of assurance sent to on-the-runs telling them they were not wanted by UK authorities. Lady Justice Hallett said the scheme was not well publicised, and effectively kept 'below the radar', but was not secret. 'The administrative scheme did not amount to an amnesty,' she said. 'Suspected terrorists were not handed a 'get out of jail free card'.' But shockingly she unearthed details of two more cases where errors were made. They included: . The Downey case triggered a political crisis at Stormont earlier this year. Many politicians, particularly unionists, reacted furiously, claiming they knew nothing about the letters. Democratic Unionist First Minister Peter Robinson threatened to resign over the matter - an ultimatum he withdrew when Mr Cameron ordered the review. A police commander subsequently claimed that 95 of those who received letters were linked, though only by intelligence, to 295 murders during the Troubles. Today Mr Robinson said the scheme was ‘wrong in principle and shambolic in practice’. He added: ‘Of course it was a get out of jail free card for Downey. 'It has the potential of being a get out of jail card for the two that Lady Justice Hallett refers to as in error, it has the potential of being a get out of jail free card for the others who were not given the caveat that was entered in some of the personal letters that were sent out. ‘And indeed it has the potential of being a get out of out jail free card for anyone who has received a letter because no one knows whether it would amount to an abuse of process application being accepted by a future judge.’ Northern Ireland's most senior police officer said it was 'highly unlikely' the two other letters sent in error would lead to the collapse of future court cases. Chief constable George Hamilton said he accepted Lady Justice Hallett's findings and apologised to the Hyde Park victims. He said: 'The difference though between those is that those errors have been identified and we have taken action around those so that even with those two additional errors mitigation is in place.' He added: 'If they ever were to come to court it is highly unlikely that an abuse of process application (to collapse the case) would be successful as it was in the Downey case because we have identified the mistake and we have done something about it.' Under the scheme the names of individuals were passed to the Government, mostly through Sinn Fein, before being handed to police and prosecutors to assess their status. A report on each individual was sent back to the Government and, if they were declared as not being wanted, a letter of assurance was then issued to the individuals. In the Commons today, Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers said: 'I know that recent events have revived painful memories for those affected by that terrible atrocity (Hyde Park) and I apologise again on behalf of this Government for any hurt that has caused.' She added: 'I fully accept the Hallett Report's conclusions and recommendations and am determined that the Government will act on them. 'But, as I have said before, as far as this Government is concerned, the OTR scheme is over.' For . more than 30 years, John Downey had the IRA bombing in Hyde Park . hanging over his head - and the families of four victims denied justice.","Labour government did deal with Sinn Fein as part of the peace process . 190 'comfort letters' told on-the-run IRA suspects they were not sought . Lady Justice Hallett says flawed scheme was hidden 'under the radar' First Minister Peter Robinson condemns 'get out of jail free card' The use of an incorrect date of birth to search a police database may have missed an offence potentially linked to an individual. An individual with the same name and same year of birth was wanted for a terrorist offence. It has not yet been established if this was the same individual who received the letter of assurance. An individual who was wanted for an offence committed after the 1998 Good Friday peace accord was sent a letter with a general assurance they were not wanted. The origin of the mistake lay in the fact the police believed they were only searching for pre-1998 offences and therefore did not outline details of the 2003 offence when informing the Northern Ireland Office that the individual was 'not wanted by the PSNI'.

dd96e5462fe97d26584be7d3bc309b3cfa1d7566,"Ed Miliband is under intense pressure to agree to two inquiries into Labour’s health service in Wales. As the Daily Mail’s investigation into allegations of appalling failings of Welsh patients dominated Prime Minister’s Questions, David Cameron accused Labour of causing the crisis by slashing NHS funding. He told MPs that the British Medical Association and even some Labour MPs were now calling for a public inquiry in Wales into claims of neglect, long waiting lists and poor access to lifesaving treatments. Facing questions: Ed Miliband at Prime Ministers' Questions yesterday, where he heard even some Labour MPs are calling for a public inquiry into the state of the Labour-run Welsh NHS - the focus of a Mail investigation . The Prime Minister also challenged Labour leader Mr Miliband to allow a separate review by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to go ahead. The international body wants to compare health services in the four nations of the UK. The Prime Minister rejected the Labour leader’s claim that the health and social care systems in England are at ‘breaking point’, with ‘millions of people unable to see their GP’ and ‘the longest waits in A&E for ten years’. Mr Cameron said under the Coalition, 1.3million more outpatients are being treated by 2,500 more nurses and 8,000 more doctors. ‘A record we can be proud of,’ he said. ‘Why? Because we invested in the NHS, they cut the NHS in Wales.’ Strain: Ed Miliband is under intense pressure to agree to two inquiries into Labour’s health service in Wales . The fourth day of the Mail’s investigation reveals how: . Yesterday the Liberal Democrats also attacked Labour’s record, accusing the party of ‘wrecking’ the NHS in Wales. Norman Lamb, the party’s health minister, said: ‘Labour will not back an independent OECD study into the NHS in Wales is because they are scared of the outcome. ‘Ed Miliband and [shadow health secretary] Andy Burnham refused to protect NHS funding in this Parliament and they can’t be trusted with it in government again.’ Mr Cameron said under the Coalition, 1.3million more outpatients are being treated by 2,500 more nurses and 8,000 more doctors. 'A record we can be proud of,’ he said. ‘Why? Because we invested in the NHS' Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb said: ‘It’s quite wrong of the Welsh Labour Party to seek to shut down debate and shut down scrutiny…when it comes to the most important issue for the people of Wales.’ Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt upped the pressure on Mr Miliband by writing to him urging him to support the OECD study ‘according to the timetable that was previously agreed with the Welsh health minister’. He added: ‘These are the facts about the Labour-run NHS in Wales today: The health budget was cut by 8 per cent; the last time A&E targets were met was in March 2008; the eight-minute ambulance response time target has been met once since May 2012.’ A senior Labour source said: ‘What we have here is a politically-motivated smear campaign by a Prime Minister who has forgotten his job is to save the NHS.’ The source said Labour had made clear it is willing for the OECD to review the health service’s record in Wales, but was concerned the Tories would use draft findings for political purposes. Last night, ambulance service trust chief Tracy Myhill apologised to patients and families ‘whose experience of our services has been unacceptable’ and she insisted that performance was improving.","PM said BMA and even some Labour MPs are calling for public inquiry .

As I posed for photographers on the Royal Albert Hall’s red carpet last week, my show-stopping, sequinned frock made me feel a million dollars. And I’m certain that as I took to the rostrum to conduct a full orchestra and choir of 280 in Handel’s Zadok  The Priest at Symfunny — a musical event held in aid of the wonderful charity Parkinson’s UK, of which I am president — no one guessed my secret. For while my elegantly cut dress could easily have passed for a designer number worth thousands of pounds, it was in fact from High Street favourite Phase Eight — with a much more modest (although, admittedly, still significant) price tag of £295. It is just one of a new wave of glamorous yet affordable red-carpet-worthy evening gowns hitting the shops in the nick of time for summer events. These full-length frocks are brilliant for older women like me because, as is the case with chunky jewellery, I find that in my 60s I can wear things that would overwhelm a younger woman.

Prospective jurors in the trial of the business partner of Maine's alleged 'Zumba prostitute' are being forced to answer personal questions about their views on sex and prostitution in open court. The questionnaire for potential members of the jury includes questions like, 'Do you have a personal or religious aversion to pornography?'; 'Are you of the opinion that prostitution should be legal?' and 'You may be shown explicit videos and photographs depicting individuals engaged in graphic sexual acts. Would viewing this evidence make it difficult for you to listen to?' On Friday, the judge in the case dismissed 46 of the 59 charges against Mark W. Strong, 59, who is accused of promoting prostitution and helping Zumba instructor Alexis Wright run a lucrative prostitution business out of her Zumba exercise studio in Kennebunk, Maine. Still on the hook: Mark Strong, right, is seen outside court with his lawyer Dan Lilley, left, last week. Strong still faces 13 counts of promoting prostitution . Sexually-charged: The prostitution charges against Alexis Wright, 30, and her business partner, Strong, have led lawyers to ask potential jurors numerous prying questions about their views on sex . Strong and Wright were both charged with invasion of privacy for allegedly videotaping Wright's encounters with the men who were paying her for sex. York County Superior Court Justice Nancy Mills ruled that the johns had no expectation of privacy when they  arrived at Wright's studio, allegedly intent on committing the crime of soliciting prostitution, the Portsmouth Herald reports. Wright's lawyer says she will fight to have the the invasion of privacy charge against her tossed, as well. However prosecutors have appealed the ruling to the Maine Supreme Justice Court, hoping to have the charges reinstated. Strong still faces 13 counts of promoting prostitution - all misdemeanors. Strong has admitted to having an affair with Wright, 30, and said he gave her a loan to fund her exercise studio. However, he denies that he knew about her alleged prostitution business or helped her promote it. Tossed: Justice Nancy Mills threw out the invasion of privacy charges against Strong, saying the johns who were allegedly videotaped by Wright had no expectation of privacy if they visited a prostitute . His lawyers say overzealous prosecutors and police have wasted valuable time and money to 'persecute' their client. The week the state supreme court also ruled that jury selection must be open to the public after the Portland Press-Herald sued, saying the media and the public should not have been barred from the proceedings. Now, prospective jurors in the close-night community must talk about their feelings about sex and sexuality in open court. Questions from a confidential jury selection sheet include: . 'Trumped up': Strong's lawyers argue that the state has spent an inordinate amount of time and money prosecuting the Kennebunk businessman and relatively minor charges . The Boston Herald speculates that lawyers might ask even more personal questions when they interrogate the jury pool - asking about domination fetishes and other sexual proclivities involved in the prostitution case. Prosecutors and Justice Mills argued that opening jury selection up to public scrutiny will make it even more difficult to find impartial jurors for the case that gained international attention and rocked the small Maine community.","Mark W Strong still faces 13 counts of promoting prostitution after the judge threw out the invasion of privacy charges against him .

df0e01ac863e5e23f283d2d3bb1de133389d552c,"Thousands of patients needing urgent medical treatment could have their conditions diagnosed remotely by doctors using Skype video calls under proposals to close and downgrade Accident and Emergency departments. Under plans seen by The Mail on Sunday, patients suffering from potentially serious symptoms such as chest and abdominal pains, pneumonia and fractures will be sent to walk-in centres to see GPs rather than go to casualty wards. But because the centres are staffed by less qualified medics, advice could come from specialist colleagues at a separate A&E ward using Skype calls. The astonishing proposal is among those being considered by the Shropshire Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG), which is planning to centralise emergency services in the region. Scroll down for video . The walk-in centres are staffed by less qualified medics, advice could come from specialist colleagues at a separate A&E ward using Skype calls . The plans mean there could be only one A&E department for more than 600,000 people across Shropshire, Telford, Wrekin and Powys. Campaigners warn it is ‘like death is being built into the system’. The draft proposals, contained in official documents lodged within the July board minutes of the CCG, also say: . The proposals are the latest planned cuts to casualty units up and down the country, and come despite a new independent report insisting A&E provision needs to expand to meet rising demand for services. The Mail on Sunday has been fighting for two years to save A&Es from closure. The latest threats mean there are now 18 units across England facing the axe. Gill George, from the Shropshire Defend Our NHS campaign group, said: ‘This is terrifying and means a death sentence for a lot of people. In a rural area, the idea of centralising everything – with already long travel times to get to A&E – is mad. ‘But there’s got to be a clinical risk in diagnosing patients over Skype because you lose so much crucial information if it’s not done in person. It’s scary they’re building risk – and possibly death – into the system.’ The region currently has two A&E departments – at the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital and at the Princess Royal in Telford, both district general hospitals. The ‘Future Fit’ programme is examining three options – locating a single A&E at either the Royal Shrewsbury or the Princess Royal, or building a new single A&E at a site between Shrewsbury and Telford. This means patients will have up to travel an additional 18 miles – around 30 minutes – for A&E services. The CCG is considering how many UCCs will be needed. David Wright, the Labour MP for Telford, said: ‘Residents are extremely concerned to yet again see a review of A&E at a time of large-scale growth in the town. We want to see full, 24-hour A&E services at our hospital and this process brings massive uncertainty.’ The current A&E service is already under pressure and paramedics were forced to wait eight hours, 11 minutes with patients outside a hospital recently because of a shortage of beds. But the ambulance service is also struggling and was fined £2.6 million after failing to meet strict eight-minute targets to reach seriously ill patients on time – one critically ill six-week-old baby had to wait 41 minutes for paramedics. The plans come as a joint report by the respected Nuffield Trust and Health Foundation found the ‘obvious answer’ to dealing with the A&E crisis ‘might appear to be increasing the capacity of A&E’. A spokesman for Shropshire CCG said: ‘Doctors and health professionals believe one single emergency centre in the area supported by UCCs is the safest way to treat the most seriously ill patients.’","Proposals by Shropshire Clinical Commissioning Group to close and downgrade Accident and Emergency departments .

Plans mean there could be  one A&E department for more than 600,000 people across Shropshire, Telford, Wrekin and Powys . A&E could be ‘ambulance only’ – so walk-in patients would be diverted to an Urgent Care Centre (UCC). Unwell or feverish children would need to go to an UCC rather than A&E – but the report acknowledges that ‘not all GPs and generalists have [the skill set to treat them]’. Paramedics may have to decide on the scene whether patients need to go to hospital or an UCC. But the report also says studies have found paramedics cannot ‘safely and accurately’ predict this. Patients who have attempted suicide, are suffering from potentially life-threatening deep vein thrombosis, and children having a wheezing fit would all be brought to UCCs. UCCs will be dealing with more serious cases, so staff will need specialists on the rota or ‘timely access’ to them via Skype."

Jazz Richards could make his first Barclays Premier League start for nearly three years with Swansea having problems at right-back for the visit of Newcastle on Saturday. Angel Rangel serves a one-match suspension after his red card at Sunderland last weekend and Dutch understudy Dwight Tiendalli is nursing a groin injury which has sidelined him since the end of August, so Richards stands by for his first top-flight start since Swansea's 1-1 draw with Tottenham in December 2011.

Newcastle boss Alan Pardew will assess striker Papiss Cisse's match fitness ahead of Saturday's Barclays Premier League trip to Swansea. The Senegal international has been used as a substitute in each of the club's last two league games following his return from a fractured kneecap, but with goals at a premium, his manager would dearly love to have him at his disposal from the start. Pardew otherwise has no fresh injury problems and while Ryan Taylor (cruciate ligament) played in a behind-closed-doors friendly in midweek, he, fellow defender Davide Santon (knee) and midfielders Siem de Jong (thigh) and Rolando Aarons (hamstring) remain on the comeback trail.

The BBC suppressed an independent review of its executive pay which found its top brass were paid up to three times more than their public sector counterparts. Despite being warned four years ago that the pay of the director general and his lieutenants far outstripped what they might earn in equivalent jobs in the civil service, corporation bosses failed to take immediate action to curb top-level pay. A study by accountants PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) for the BBC Trust in 2009 found their basic salaries were instead on a par with the chiefs of aggressively profit-making FTSE 100 companies, despite the fact they are paid with licence fee payers’ money. No action: Despite warnings, Corporation bosses failed to take action to curb top salaries . Instead of risking embarrassment by publishing it in full, BBC bosses kept the report under wraps until it was released under Freedom of Information laws. Last night, MPs condemned the BBC for failing to publish the explosive findings earlier and said it illustrated a ‘fill your boots at public expense’ culture at the top of the corporation. Laying bare the true extent of BBC largesse, the newly released documents reveal: . Last night Conservative MP Stephen Barclay, who sits on the influential public accounts committee of MPs, said executives would be asked to explain why the report was suppressed at its next hearing in September. The PwC report was commissioned by former BBC Trust chairman Sir Michael Lyons in April 2009 in response to widespread dismay at senior staff bonuses that year. Instead of publishing the report, the BBC’s executive remuneration committee – including Mr Thompson – discussed its findings in private and never published it in full. Review: The PwC report was commissioned by former BBC Trust chairman Sir Michael Lyons in April 2009 . At a meeting in July 2009, the committee decided BBC pay should be aligned with executives in the commercial public sector meaning the BBC could justify paying its executives far higher salaries. Yesterday a BBC spokesman justified the decision to benchmark its pay against the commercial public sector by saying the corporation needed to compete for talent with commercial media rivals. But Tory MP Stewart Jackson, who also sits on the public accounts committee, said: ‘There seems to have been a culture under the previous director general of “fill your boots at public expense and the expense of the licence fee payer”. The gravy train has finally hit the buffers. Those responsible must be held fully accountable for it.’ A BBC spokesman said: ‘A great deal has been done since 2009 to address issues around executive remuneration at the BBC. ‘Following this review, the senior management paybill has been reduced by more than 30 per cent, the director general’s salary has come down almost 33 per cent, while the ratio of director-general’s salary to median pay has fallen from 16.8 to 11 and bonuses have been permanently withdrawn from executive directors.’","The BBC Trust commissioned a study of basic salaries back in 2009 .

The BBC’s executive remuneration committee was warned former director general Mark Thompson’s £651,000 basic salary was more than three times what he would be able to earn in an equivalent role in the civil service, Army or judiciary. The corporation’s top ten earners, including former deputy director general Mark Byford on £609,000 and former chief operating officer Caroline Thomson on £430,000, were paid on average more than twice their public sector counterparts. On average, basic salaries were only 4 per cent lower than the private sector. The BBC’s executive remuneration committee decided to use high-paying ‘commercial public sector’ institutions – such as Network Rail or the Tote – as a benchmark for pay rather than more frugal ‘core’ public sector examples, such as the civil service. Minutes show they realised the decision was ‘likely to be contentious’. Similar reviews have been carried out every year since 2009. They show executive salaries still exceed the agreed benchmark, but the BBC has redacted the documents to prevent the public from knowing by how much."

She's known for her bestselling workout DVDs – and now TV presenter Davina McCall is gearing up to release a book on how she has successfully banished sugar from her diet. The recipe book, Five Weeks To Sugar Free, will be published in January to capitalise on the good intentions of people making New Year resolutions. Davina, right, says: ‘Every time I pick up a magazine, I read another horrifying fact about sugar. I was a committed sugar addict until I managed to stop for three years, only to take it up again with gusto. This book shows you how I finally quit but still get to eat lovely puddings.’ The book will be the first of three, and if it’s anything like Davina’s hugely popular workout DVDs, which trade on her attainable image as a busy mother of three, it should be a huge hit. Taking probiotic supplements can be effective in reducing the occurrence and duration of sore throats, coughs and colds among children .","TV presenter releasing book on how she banned sugar from her diet . The recipe book, Five Weeks To Sugar Free, will be published in January . Davina has already seen huge success with her workout DVDs . Taking probiotic supplements can be effective in reducing the occurrence and duration of sore throats, coughs and colds among children.  According to a study in the European Journal Of Clinical Nutrition, pre-school youngsters who took a chewable ProVen Fit For School blackcurrant-flavour tablet had less severe symptoms and, as a result, needed fewer days off. The tablets are suitable for four- to 16-year-olds. It pays to volunteer, especially as you get older, because it staves off depression. Officials at the Rotman Research Institute in Toronto examined 73 studies published over 45 years that looked at adults aged 50-plus in formal volunteering roles. They found that those who helped out had reduced symptoms of depression, better overall health and lived longer. Researchers, whose findings were published online in Psychological Bulletin, said that between two and three hours a week was the optimal amount to volunteer."

A Whitehall inquiry found ‘clear evidence’ that £476,250 was granted over a decade to two organisations connected to the notorious Paedophile Information Exchange. The findings were released yesterday as Home Secretary Theresa May announced a major inquiry into how public bodies dealt with historical allegations of child sex abuse. Scroll down for video . A Whitehall inquiry found that £476,250 was granted to organisations connected to the Paedophile Information Exchange. The findings were released as Home Secretary Theresa May (above) announced a major inquiry . As the paedophile scandal continued to engulf Westminster, it also emerged that: . A Daily Mail investigation earlier this year revealed shocking links between PIE, which campaigned for the age of consent to be dramatically lowered, and three senior Labour figures who held key roles in the National Council for Civil Liberties. Former health secretary Patricia Hewitt was forced to apologise for her dealings with PIE, although Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman and her husband, home affairs spokesman Jack Dromey, strongly denied giving any support to the pro-paedophile group. Last December a former employee accused the Home Office of giving tens of thousands of pounds to PIE through its Voluntary Services Unit, which provided annual grants for charities. Civil servants launched a trawl through 35,000 documents to investigate the claims, focusing on the VSU’s activities between 1973 and 1985. Their findings were finally published yesterday, prompting concerns that it had been timed so it would be overshadowed by Mrs May’s announcement of an over-arching inquiry. It found that two groups associated with the child sex-supporting lobbyists did receive hundreds of thousands of pounds from the VSU. Earlier this year former health secretary Patricia Hewitt (Above) was forced to apologise for her dealings with to the notorious Paedophile Information Exchange . Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman (left) and her husband, home affairs spokesman Jack Dromey (right), have previously strongly denied giving any support to the Paedophile Information Exchange group . The Albany Trust, which was founded to support ‘sexual minorities’, received £65,750 between 1974 and 1980. The trust invited representatives from PIE and a group called Paedophile Action for Liberation to a series of meetings in 1975 to discuss setting up a paedophile support group and publishing an information pamphlet about paedophilia. In 1977 the Home Office expressed ‘some disquiet’ about the way in which the trust was carrying out its work, the report noted. In 1970 the Albany Trust funded the translation of the findings of a Dutch government inquiry, known as the Speijer Report, which looked at lowering the age of consent for homosexuals. Campaigner Mary Whitehouse alleged that PIE obtained this English translation several years later and sold it for £1 per copy. A second charity, Release, which offered advice on issues including drugs, medical and housing problems, was given £410,500 by the VSU between 1974 and 1984 via the Princedale Trust. In 1975 Release moved to 1 Elgin Avenue in London. The same year Release allowed PIE to begin using the same address for correspondence. The Home Office report said it was ‘impossible to determine’ whether VSU money given to the two charities was indirectly used to support PIE’s work, although it noted no evidence was found to confirm that it did. A Whitehall inquiry found 'clear evidence' that £476,250 was granted to the organisations while the Home Office was situated in its former location in Petty France, Westminster (above) It also emerged that prosecutors decided in 1998 not to lay child abuse charges against Liberal MP Cyril Smith (left) despite ruling they were likely to succeed and that former home secretary Lord Brittan (right) insisted allegations that he failed to deal properly with allegations of child abuse were completely without foundation . The report said the whistleblower’s account of seeing a Home Office document from about 1980 that listed a grant renewal of £30,000 for PIE was ‘credible’. But the review concluded that ‘on the balance of probabilities’ no money was given to PIE. Simon Danczuk, the Labour MP for Rochdale who exposed Cyril Smith’s abuse and led calls for a full inquiry into the alleged official cover-up of child abuse, said: ‘This report raises as many questions as it answers about the Home Office’s use of public funds to support groups linked to the Paedophile Information Exchange. ‘This does little to end concerns about the Home Office’s handling of child sexual abuse allegations over many years. ‘Releasing the report on the same day that the Home Secretary announced a major public inquiry into these issues will make some people wonder whether there has been an attempt to bury its findings.’","Inquiry found 'clear evidence' that £476,250 was granted to organisations .

Huge pension pot: Ian Marchant (pictured) will get nearly £400,000 a year from the company when he leaves SSE in the summer . The man in charge of one of Britain's biggest energy firms will receive an annual pension pot of £400,000 despite the company being found guilty of ripping off one million customers. Ian Marchant will get the payout worth up to £9million after 10 years of working at the helm of SSE which has been hit with a £10.5million fine following an investigation by energy regulator Ofgem. Marchant, chief executive of the company, was paid just over £1million last year with a £158,000 'cash incentive' on top of his basic salary of £840,000. There have also been calls for the rest of the company’s management team to be sacked. On a day of shame for the power industry, SSE was attacked for ‘failing its customers’ through ruthless ‘mis-selling’, either on people’s doorsteps, over the telephone or on the high street. Hundreds of thousands of new . customers were attracted to switch from other suppliers at the height of . the racket – which lasted for three years – and many ended up paying . higher tariffs. While the fine is the largest-ever . handed out by Ofgem, it is a tiny fraction of the company’s profits. Last year, it made annual pre-tax profits of £1.3billion. As MPs and consumer groups said the scandal was ‘fraud’ and required a police investigation, it emerged that: . Scroll down for video . SSE headquarters in Perth has been handed the largest ever penalty imposed on an energy provider . Barry Gardiner, a Labour MP who also . sits on the energy select committee, said: ‘The activities that SSE have . engaged in appear to be nothing short of fraud. It would be appropriate . for the regulator to refer this matter for further investigation by the . police.’ Michael Fallon, the Energy Minister, said he had ‘rarely seen a . worse case of consumers being misled so badly’. Ofgem launched a probe in 2010 amid . claims families, pensioners and other victims were encouraged to switch . from their energy provider to SSE, lured by the prospect of saving . money. But in fact they were switching to a . deal with the company, formerly known as Scottish & Southern Energy, . which was ‘more expensive’. Pensioners Frank and Maureen Price, from . Rotherham, told how they were left with huge debts after being persuaded . to switch to SSE by a door-to-door salesman. Energy watchdog Ofgem said it found 'failures at every stage of the sales process' across SSE's telephone, in-store and doorstep selling activities . The couple were told they would make . substantial savings but have ended up paying hundreds of pounds extra . every year after their tariff more than doubled from £61 a month to . £158. Mr Price, 83, described their ordeal . as ‘distressing’ saying they can no longer afford to go on holiday and . have had to cut out all luxuries. In another case, a woman, who was . paying £1,600 a year for her energy bill, was told her bill would drop . to £1,423. In fact, it jumped to £1,734. Sarah Harrison, senior partner at . Ofgem, said: ‘SSE failed its customers, mis-sold to them and undermined . trust in the energy supply industry.’ Ofgem said SSE’s doorstep sales team . was managed by people who ‘received a commission on sales’. It said they . ‘therefore had a financial interest in not reporting misbehaviour’. Yesterday SSE said it has written to . around 970,000 of its customers who might have been misled into signing . up as an energy customer. It has set aside a compensation pot of around . £5million, and has already paid out around £400,000. The average payout . is around £65. Other customers who suspect that they . might also have been duped into switching to SSE were yesterday urged . to get in touch with the company with their grievance. SSE, based in Perth, said it was . ‘deeply regretful’ of its actions, which Ofgem said began in 2009 and . ended in September last year. Adam Scorer, director of policy at . Consumer Focus, said: ‘This is not a case of one bad apple. The problems . at SSE…represent a fundamental failure.’ Ofgem said it had decided against . referring the matter to the police because it had not found evidence SSE . had deliberately intended to mis-sell to its customers. Luciana Berger, the shadow minister . for climate change, said: ‘It would be completely unacceptable for the . energy bosses responsible for this scandal to get any kind of bonus when . SSE announce their financial results later this year.’ Tory MP Peter Lilley added: ‘If I were a shareholder, I would be very surprised if the top management remained in place.’ An M&S Energy spokesman said the . scandal has affected ‘less than one per cent of M&S Energy . customers.’ Unlike the majority of its rivals, SSE remains a .

This is the first time the two World Cup finalists have met in the tournament directly after contesting the final since 1990, when West Germany beat Argentina 1-0 in the final (after meeting each other in 1986). La Roja lost their opening game of the 2010 World Cup to Switzerland, but went on to become the first team to ever win the tournament having lost their first game. Vicente Del Bosque has only lost one of his 25 World Cup games as Spain head-coach, including qualifiers (W22 D2). That was against Switzerland (0-1) in 2010. David Villa - Spain’s top scorer at World Cup Finals (eight goals) - has been directly involved in seven of Spain’s last nine goals in the tournament (six goals, one assist). Spain have won their last six World Cup games, their best ever run in the tournament. Their last four games have ended in 1-0 wins. Spain have kept a clean sheet in each of their last four World Cup games, the longest current run. Indeed only Italy (five games in 1990) and Switzerland (five in 2006 & 2010) have ever had a longer run in the competition.

Or did it end in a huge, stonking row with both of you on your sides, staring stonily at opposite walls? Valentine's day is one of the two days in the year that couples argue the most, this is because we are often left disappointed, here Tracey Cox explains why he's not living up to your expectations . If it's the latter, you're not alone. Valentine's Day and New Year's Eve are the two nights of the year couples are most likely to argue. Why? Expectations are high - and men and women's idea of romance are streets apart. Make this Valentine's run smoother by seeing things from a different perspective... 1. HE DIDN'T SEND FLOWERS TO WORK . Why is it infinitely better for a huge, expensive bunch of flowers to arrive at the office rather than be delivered in person by him? The show off factor, of course. Everyone wants to look like the most adored person in the office and what if everyone except you got sent flowers? Good reasons why he didn't: . From being low on funds to feeling intimidated by the way you look there are plenty of reasons why he isn't conforming to your idea of the perfect Valentine's date . 2. HE DIDN'T BOOK THE RIGHT RESTAURANT . There are three Valentines' choices that go down well. Dinner in your 'special' restaurant - where you met or he proposed or something else significantly romantic happened. Dinner in the hottest place in town (so you can boast the next day) or dinner somewhere expensive. His 'Let's give V-Day the finger and head to the local pizza joint!' suggestion does not go down well. Good reasons why he didn't: . Tracey says that it's important to bear in mind that his definition of romance isn't necessarily yours . 3. HE DIDN'T TELL YOU HOW FAB YOU LOOKED . Your hair's blow-dry glossy, you spent two week's salary on your dress, your shoes are so high, your little toe's already throbbing - and all he says after a quick once-over is 'Hi! Happy Valentine's Day.' Would it kill him to say 'You look better than Rosie Huntington-Whiteley - on a good day'? Good reasons why he didn't: . 4. THE PRESENT DIDN'T COST ENOUGH . 'It's the thought that counts' might apply when it's your five-year-old niece lovingly pressing an old sweet wrapper into your hand for Christmas. But a hell of a lot of women think the more money he spends, the more he loves them. Good reasons why he didn't spend up big: . 5. HE WASN'T AFFECTIONATE ENOUGH . You're smack bang in the middle of a packed restaurant, surrounded by tons of couples who are all over each other. He's not even holding your hand across the table or playing footsie. Why he isn't: . 6. HE DIDN'T SAY ROMANTIC THINGS . On every other day of the year, he's always coming out with the cutest, nicest comments about how much he adores you. On the day when he's supposed to, nada. One strained 'I love you' and that was that. Why he didn't: . 7. HE DIDN'T PROPOSE . You're checking your Champagne glass, digging around in the chocolate fondant with your spoon, eyeing off his jacket pocket to see if it's bulging. Where is he hiding that damn ring? Why he didn't: . It really doesn't mean he doesn't love you, if he doesn't make a fuss on Valentine's Day. Some guys are just conscientious objectors to the concept and, let's be honest here, it takes little effort to call and order a bunch of red roses. There are infinitely better ways to express love and his definition of romance isn't necessarily yours. One of my all time favourite research statistics is the study where men in long-term relationships were asked to do something romantic for their wives. Forty percent washed her car! I rest my case. For inspired Valentine's Day ideas on what to buy, see Tracey's gift guide suggestions for him and her.","Valentine's Day is one of the two nights a year couples argue the most . This is because we have massive expectations and are left disappointed . Tracey Cox explains exactly why he might make mistakes this Saturday . Because you work with women who date bankers and if he can't compete, he figures you'd prefer his more modest bunch handed over privately. Because he baulked at paying a delivery fee that's tripled for one day of year. Because it seemed more practical to give them to you himself, since he was seeing you that night. Because it's excruciating to have to sit there and look loving and say all the right things in a restaurant he feels comfortable in, let alone one where he's terrified he'll pick up the wrong fork. He can't afford it. He figured cooking a meal for you himself was more special. You seriously do give Rosie a run for her money and he's suddenly paranoid he's not good-looking enough for you. He clocked you've gone to a lot of effort to look good and worried the present isn't right/expensive enough/you're upset because he didn't send flowers to work. He actually prefers you in your old skinny jeans and a T-shirt. You don't seem like you 'all done up'. He can't afford it and can't justify hiking up the credit card even higher when he's likely to need it for important things. Like rent. He secretly suspects you're a gold digger and wants to test whether you're with him for his money by not being extravagant. He didn't have a clue what to buy so procrastinated - and ended up in Paperchase half an hour before you were due to meet. He's inwardly cringing at how forced everyone else looks. He feels that if he follows suit, he'll look forced. Or clichéd. Or just plain stupid. Besides he can feel you turning into Ms Frosty Pops and he's scared he'll be rebuffed and look even more idiotic. He feels so self-conscious in this environment, he's scared he'll laugh. See above. Surrounded by all the cheesy hearts and pink balloons and red roses, he's already suffocating in sentiment. He thinks anything he says will seem disingenuous - that he's only saying it because he's supposed to. He resents being told to do something romantic on a certain day of the year just because society dictates it. He didn't think you'd want to share your anniversary with millions of other couples. He's planning on doing it somewhere private and more meaningful than in front of a room full of strangers. You've only been dating two months."
22fc6592b46af282444d216b88a6e858bf6c4b18,"Joshua R. Hensler, social media manager at US Airways, calls himself a 'web alchemist' and 'aggressive engineer of perception' on his LinkedIn profile. His boasts will be taken in a very different light today as he emerged as a manager at the US Airways social media team behind what has been branded the 'worst tweet of all time'. An employee sparked a firestorm on Twitter yesterday after an extremely graphic picture of a woman engaged in a sex act with a model Boeing 777 was tweeted to a customer who complained about her Spring Break flight - and to its 418,000 followers. Scroll down for video . 'Web alchemist' and 'aggressive engineer of perception': Joshua R. Hensler, the social media manager at US Airways has apparently called the employee responsible a 'giant a**hole' Graphic: US Airways has apologized after their official Twitter account tweeted an extremely inappropriate photo (which MailOnline has blanked over) on Monday afternoon . It quickly became one of the top trending hashtags on Twitter - a dream for any social media manager. But for Hensler it wasn't the 'perception engineering' he had in mind. While it is not yet known which employee was behind the monumental error, Hensler apparently had some choice words for him or her. Reacting today in the only way he would - on social media - he posted on Facebook: 'Whenever someone says: ""I'm sorry, it's just who I am."" What they really mean is: ""I am a giant a**hole and have no plans of improving myself as a human""'. He has since deleted the message from his public profile. This was hours after he posted, in a huge understatement: 'I've seen better days'. Hensler, who works out of the airline's headquarters in Phoenix, Arizona, was unavailable for comment. But a spokesman for USAirways' partner American Airlines said Hensler had no involvement with the incident and was not managing the team. The spokesman claimed the Facebook messages were unrelated. The 30-year-old, who says on Facebook he is in an open relationship, went to Westminster College in Pennsylvania, and boasts on his LinkedIn profile that he is the 'Captain of Crunch Time' and his responsibilities include being part of the Crisis and Communications Response Team. Those skills will be sorely needed now. Choice words: Hensler reacts, appropriately on Facebook, to the monumental error that has attracted all the wrong sort of attention to US Airways . Captain of Crunch Time: Hensler talks the language of the internet on his LinkedIn profile . US Airways has had to profusely apologize for the mistake which has spawned a torrent of puns mocking the airline online. Today, the airline said it will not fire the employee, adding that it was an 'honest mistake' and and an 'attempt to flag the tweet as inappropriate'. 'We captured it, flagged it as inappropriate,' a spokesman for the airline said. 'We are in the midst of reviewing our processes but for the most part we have an understanding of what happened and how to ensure how it won't happen in the future.' It all started when the image was initally posted to the USAirways Twitter stream by a user. It was flagged as inappropriate by the team that manages their Twitter account. But then a young woman, Alex, tweeted directly to US Airways early on Monday morning that her flight to Portland had been delayed - demanding 'free stuff' because her vacation was off to a bad start. In reply, the airlines official Twitter account replied, 'We don’t like to hear this, Alex.  Please provide feedback to our Customer Relations team here,' and attached the explicit photograph of the nude woman out to its followers 'by accident'. US Airways said: 'We apologize for an . inappropriate image recently shared as a link in one of our responses. We’ve removed the tweet and are investigating.' The . tweet was deleted but spent 22 minutes online - enough time to cause a . frenzy of sharing among incredulous users of the social media app. Incredulous: The public's reaction to US Airways staggering tweet ranged from humor to sympathy for whoever was responsible . The replies to the offensive tweet ranged from laughter to outrage. The image in question was attached to a . tweet sent to @AmericanAir at 1:59PM, 30 minutes before US Airways sent . out a tweet with the same image attached.  American Airlines and US .

For more than a century the corridors and wards of Broadmoor have remained closed to the public, its practices such as using six guards to open the door for one patient a closely guarded secret. But now Broadmoor has decided to open its doors and reveal the inside of the country's highest security psychiatric hospital. Scroll down for video . Broadmoor is the UK's most secure hospital and has remained hidden from the public for the last 150 years . CCTV cameras cover the 15 wards of the Berkshire hospital to ensure staff and patients are kept safe . Pictures inside the site in Berkshire show long corridors, heavy secure doors and rooms where anything that could be turned into a weapon is removed. Security is high, with bars throughout the hospital's wards and signs warning staff they must wear personal attack alarms at all times. When they are with patients staff are told to wear body cameras. The caution is not without reason. Staff in Broadmoor are attacked on average four times a week, which can involve punching, kicking or in some cases patients fashioning plastic cutlery into knives. A kitchen in Canterbury ward shows patients' artwork on the walls, produced during monitored sessions . A view into a patients bedroom (left) and heavy secure doors, equipped with observation holes for staff (right) Around 30 times a year staff are called to disarm patients while all must have riot training and are equipped with helmets and shields. A control room with a wall covered in screens allows staff to monitor patients and workers in the hospital's 15 wards which are covered with CCTV. Security is high and is essential to safeguard staff as much as patients - most of whom will be on a combination of medication to treat psychiatric disorders. The hospital is secure, with fencing throughout, and signs warning staff to carry personal attack alarms . Broadmoor entrance gate 60 became an iconic feature, the inside of which has remained secret . Dr Amlan Basu, Clinical Director of Broadmoor, said: 'Patients that come here, they will have perpetrated often horrendous crimes but they are also victims and it's very easy to see somebody as either the perpetrator or the victim. It's much more difficult to understand that somebody might be both.' Some  are able to earn money in a tuck shop by making arts and crafts, but security has to be high to ensure any potential weapons are removed. All tools are checked in and out during every session. The inside of the secure hospital has been revealed in an ITV documentary, filmed over a year throughout the hospital. Security is high at Broadmoor Hospital, with zonal fencing, security signs and CCTV covering all the wards . Staff are reminded to take care of security as there are around four attacks every week on hospital workers . Broadmoor hospital has housed some of Britain's most notorious killers from the Victorian era and today . In Cranfield ward, notorious for its violent patients, some patients are so ill that six staff must be used to open a single cell door. The pictures and documentary have provided a rare insight into the hospital for the first time in its 150 year history. Taxpayers pay around £300,000 a year to house each patient, at a cost of £60million, the Sunday Mirror reported. Peter Sutcliffe, the Yorkshire Ripper (left), Ronnie Kray (centre picture - front), and tea poisoner Graham Young (right) have all been patients at Broadmoor in Berkshire, which houses 200 violent psychiatric patients . Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe (left) is pictured with Sir Jimmy Savile (centre) and Frank Bruno at Broadmoor . Broadmoor, often incorrectly referred to as a prison, has housed some of the most infamous patients, some of them serial killers: .

The hospital has tight security for patients . After he was released he tried to poison 70 more people. Designed by a military engineer, Broadmoor was the first custom-built asylum to house criminals when it was developed in 1863. But it has since been known as a psychiatric hospital. It may eventually be turned into a hotel as a new site is now being built next door. Broadmoor is one of three maximum security psychiatric hospitals in the UK, the others being Ashworth and Rampton. The show will be broadcast on November 5 at 9pm on ITV.","Broadmoor Hospital is home to some of the UK's most notorious killers .

c50b924b7cf4f3252cd3230143c56b6018b89de3,"By . Damien Gayle . PUBLISHED: . 07:45 EST, 26 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:08 EST, 26 February 2013 . Laptops, tablets and smartphones have dramatically changed the way we work - and even the way we sit, researchers have claimed. A new study has found that most desks, designed for traditional 'desktop' computers, have meant we have created a range of new ways to sit. They range from 'the cocoon', where people hunch up on their chair to be close to their phone, to 'the smart lean', used to  check emails during a meeting. The nine new workplace postures: These new ways of sitting and slouching to fit ourselves around new mobile computing technology have been identified by research from office furniture company Steelcase . Smartphones and tablet computers, small and light enough to be grasped in the hands, have liberated workers from postural slavery to our digital overseers. Now new research has shown that the change in the ways we deal with technology in the workplace is indeed changing the way that we sit and slouch while we're earning our keep. A survey of 2,000 office workers in 11 countries undertaken by office furniture maker Steelcase has identified nine new postures which have emerged in response to the new technologies we interact with. They are: . Contorting to fit: Office workers have hitherto been kept in postural bondage to the immobile machines they interact with to earn their keep . The new postures identified were a result of using small, mobile technology such as smartphones, tablets and laptops and new workplace behaviours. However, with furniture poorly adapted to these new ways of sitting and slouching, Steelcase notes, they frequently cause pain and long-term injuries, disrupting concentration and creativity. James Ludwig, vice president of global design for Steelcase, said: 'We love our technology – it’s become a ubiquitous extension of ourselves. 'But the way technology impacts our bodies as we work has been largely ignored.' Based on this research, Steelcase has designed a new chair – Gesture – that moves with the body and supports the user throughout the different postures.  It will be available in the UK later this year.","Mobile devices have changed the way that office workers sit at their desks, study shows . Office furniture maker Steelcase surveyed more than 2,000 people in countries to identify nine new postures . The Draw – Technology (small and mobile) allows people to pull back from their desks while they use it. They recline, signaling they’re contemplating or absorbing information and draw the device closer to their body to maintain an optimal focal length. The Multi-Device - This posture is representative of how people adapt to multitasking on multiple-devices. One hand holding a phone to the ear, the other tasking on a laptop. The result is a forward lean that is a symbol of concentration and an orientation to the smaller screen of a laptop. The Text - Smartphones are small compared to other forms of technology and, therefore, require unique postures. Workers bring arms in close as keying and gesturing are performed. The Cocoon - People recline, bring up their feet onto the seat, and draw their smartphone or tablet close, resting on their thighs. The result is a cocoon - small mobile technology allows people to remain productive in this posture. The Swipe - This posture results when the device is used on a work surface in 'surfing mode', in which people operate the device with one hand, typically with swiping gestures. Because it’s on a work surface, a person must keep their head a certain distance above the tablet in order to see it, and position their head to look down at it. The Smart Lean - This posture is the result of mobile devices that create the desire for people to temporarily 'pull away' from others without leaving a meeting or collaborative environment. This is typically a temporary posture and used for glancing at incoming texts or e-mails. The Trance - This posture was observed when people were focused on the screen and either mousing or using a touchpad to navigate on the screen for extended periods of time. This is a long duration posture. The Take It In - In this posture, people recline to view content on the large display and/or sit back to contemplate. This posture is about 'taking in' information rather than generating it. The Strunch . - The 'strunch' (stretched-out hunch) is a very common posture with . laptops. As people become fatigued, they gradually push their laptop . further from the edge of the worksurface, resting their weight on the . surface.  This causes them to reach forward to work. Since the back and . neck cannot sustain the reach and hunch posture for a long time, the . person begins to prop themselves up with their non- tasking arm."

John 'Boy' Ward, 33, shot Thomas Ward, 21, who was the son of his cousin, at a caravan site in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, over a long-standing family feud. The court heard the murderer had phoned his victim in 2011 and told him: 'It's me, your enemy. I'm going to wait until you are at your happiest - then I'm going to get you.' Thomas Ward's wife Theresa gave birth to his daughter five days before he was killed on 23 April 2013. Scroll down for video . Thomas Ward, 21, (left) was shot at a caravan site in Stevenage by John 'Boy' Ward (right) over a family feud . A window of his caravan was smashed while the couple and their daughter were asleep. Opening the door with just a piece of kitchen cutlery for protection, Thomas was confronted by three masked men, one armed with a 12 gauge shotgun in April last year. With his wife standing behind him, he was shot in the chest and died less than an hour later in hospital. John Price QC, prosecuting, told the jury at St Albans Crown Court: 'Thomas Ward was the victim of an execution.' Clips of the funeral were shown on Channel 4's My Big Fat Gypsy Christening in October 2013. On the programme, his father, James 'Young Fox' Ward said: 'They shot him in a cold blooded murder. The police officer said at the time that it was an assassination. He never had a chance.' The funeral of Thomas Ward was featured on Channel 4's My Big Fat Gypsy Christening . The trial heard the feud began when Thomas's father, James 'Young Fox' Ward, was held responsible by some family members for the death of his cousin Micky Ward in a car crash in 1987. Six years later James Ward shot dead Micky's brother James 'Bimbo' Ward and was jailed for manslaughter. John 'Boy' Ward was the younger brother of the two dead men. On the Channel 4 programme, James 'Young Fox' Ward said: 'I had an argument 20 odd years ago with a cousin and he died subsequently in the fight and I went to prison for it. 'Why did they not kill me, I don't understand.' Thomas had not been born when the feud began, but Mr Price, prosecuting, said: 'To John Ward, it was immaterial - Thomas Ward shared the sins of his father.' The trial heard the feud started when Thomas's father, James 'Young Fox' Ward (pictured left) was held responsible by some family members for the death of his cousin in a car crash in 1987 - his father said he did not understand why his son (pictured right) was killed instead of him . Following the shooting John 'Boy' Ward, from Hatfield, used a fake passport to travel on Eurostar to Brussels. His wife Joeleen, who was five months pregnant, then flew out from East Midlands Airport to meet him in Paris. They went on the run, travelling around France and Spain before settling in Helsingor in Denmark. Giving evidence during his trial, John 'Boy' Ward said he had panicked and fled after the shooting because he knew he would be blamed. He said he was scared to return to the UK because he'd heard there was a £100,000 'contract' out on him. He said: 'I heard there was a contract put on my head. £50,000 to find where I was and £50,000 to kill me.' Hundreds of travellers attended the funeral of Thomas Ward, who was shot by John 'Boy' Ward . Joeleen Ward, 22 – who was also on trial with her husband accused of helping him to escape – said her child had been born while they were on the run together in Europe. In the witness box she sobbed and spoke of her fears for her son's future safety because of the family feud. 'I'm still scared for my son growing up,' she told the jury. She was found guilty of a charge of assisting her husband to flee the country following the shooting and will be sentenced in November after reports have been prepared. John 'Boy' Ward's brother, Francis Ward, 36, and his sister Winifred, 47, also pleaded not guilty to assisting his escape from the UK. Francis Ward, from Kensington was convicted of assisting an offender and his sister – of  Hounslow – was convicted of an identical charge. They, too, will be sentenced with Joeleen in November. Thomas's father, James 'Young Fox' Ward, pictured with his mother, Lily, was sent to jail for 13 months in July for trying to avenge his son's death . In July this year, Thomas's father, James 'Young Fox' Ward, was jailed for 13 months after he flipped his BMW sports car while drunkenly driving around in a revenge mission to find his son's killers. James Ward flipped the car on to its roof after ploughing into another vehicle when he got behind the wheel while drunk, uninsured and disqualified from driving. He crashed into another vehicle, causing serious injuries to a woman and child who were inside the car, who had to be airlifted to hospital.","John 'Boy' Ward, 33, shot Thomas Ward, 21 over a bitter family feud .

Not only is the weekend lie in the stuff of your weekday dreams, but sleep, along with food, water and oxygen, is essential for human survival. And the amount of shut eye a person gets each night, provides a vital indicator of their overall health. But it seems some of us aren't getting enough time between the sheets.

Past studies have found a lack of sleep can increase a person's risk of obesity, heart disease and diabetes, shortening life expectancy. In order to determine exactly how much sleep a person needs at each stage of their life, a team of 18 specialists from sleep, anatomy and physiology, as well as paediatrics, neurology, gerontology and gynaecology convened to form an expert panel. The scientists at the NSF in the US worked for two years to produce the most up-to-date guidance. And their findings revealed children  from the age of four months to 17 years old need more sleep than was previously thought. The report states: 'Importantly, the panel emphasised that some individuals might sleep longer or shorter than the recommended times with no adverse effects. 'However, individuals with sleep durations far outside the normal range may be engaging in volitional sleep restriction or have serious health problems. 'An individual who intentionally restricts sleep over a prolonged period may be comprising his or her health and well-being.' The panel recommend: . The NSF's report found children aged four months to 17 years old need more sleep than was previously recommended. Past studies have found a lack of sleep can increase a person's risk of obesity, heart disease and diabetes, shortening life expectancy . Charles Czeisler, chair of the board of the NSF and chief of sleep medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital, said: 'This is the first time that any professional organisation has developed age-specific recommended sleep durations based on a rigorous, systematic review of the world scientific literature relating sleep duration to health, performance and safety. The expert panel said following simple yet effective advice it is possible to improve sleeping habits. They include: . * Sticking to a regular sleep schedule - even at the weekend . * Practising a relaxing bedtime ritual . * Exercising daily . * Switching off all technology some time before going to bed . 'The NSF is providing these scientifically grounded guidelines on the amount of sleep we need each night to improve the sleep health of the millions of individuals and parents who rely on us for this information. 'As the voice for sleep health it is the NSF's responsibility to make sure that our recommendations are supported by the most rigourous science. 'Individuals, particularly parents, rely on us for this information.' Max Hirshkowitz, chair of the NSF Scientific Advisory Council, added: 'The public can be confident that these recommendations represent the best guidance for sleep duration and health.' David Cloud, chief executive of the NSF, added: 'The NSF sleep duration recommendations will help individuals make sleep schedules that are within a healthy range. 'They also serve as a useful starting point for individuals to discuss their sleep with their health care providers.'

Residents of the predominantly white and wealthy southern part of Baton Rouge have launched a campaign to split from the rest of Louisiana's state capital and form their own breakaway city. If the campaigners get their way, the new city of St. George would encompass 107,000 residents, around 25 percent of Baton Rouge’s current population. Critics of the St. George proposal argue . that it would create a poor, black, and urban Baton Rouge and a . wealthy, white, and suburban St. George. Redrawing the map: Residents of the predominantly white and wealthy southern part of Baton Rouge have launched a campaign to split from the rest of Louisiana's state capital and form their own breakaway city of St. George . Perkins Rowe is one of two exclusive malls that would fall within the proposed boundaries of St. George and therefore deny Baton Rouge of valuable sales tax dollars . Supporters of the proposal say they have . about half of the 18,000 signatures they need to put incorporating St. George on the next ballot. Significantly the proposed new city would include two major retail centers, Perkins Rowe and the Mall of Louisiana, that currently provide Baton Rouge with 40 percent of its sales tax revenue. The split campaign emerged out of the ashes of a failed campaign to create a new school district. When state legislature mothballed those proposals in June - claiming they couldn’t approve an independent school district that was unaffiliated with a city - organizers shifted their energies to the creation of St. George, reports Raw Story. After Hurricane Katrina, the city of Baton Rouge accepted over 200,000 displaced New Orleans residents, the majority of whom were black and settled in the northern, urban parts of the city . The split campaign emerged out of the ashes of a failed campaign to create a new school district by the wealthy, predominantly white residents of southern Baton Rouge . According to recent study on the . demographic impact of Hurricane Katrina, the city of Baton Rouge . accepted over 200,000 displaced New Orleans residents, the majority of . whom were black and settled in the northern, urban parts of the city. Leaders of the St. George secession effort deny that this is the reason behind their plans. They claim the new city will be ‘wide open’ and downplay warnings of fiscal disaster for the rest of the city. ‘Typically, the only comments you hear are those that try to create fear,’ one of the leaders of the movement, Norman Browning said. ‘They never support it with any documentation to make those claims.’ But opponents note that city funds were used to develop the retail areas that would end up sucking in sales taxes from residents of the poorer part of the city. Norman Browning, right, one of the leaders of the St. George movement claims there is no proof that the split will have an adverse effect on Baton Rouge, while councilwoman C. Denise Marcelle says the proposed change will affect everyone . ‘If they pull away from Baton Rouge, it will affect everyone,’ City Councilwoman C. Denise Marcelle told The Morning Advocate. ‘We’ve spent millions of dollars on improvements out there and making traffic better, and now they want to be their own city?’ A study by the Baton Rouge Area Chamber found that the effects of the partition would be economically devastating for the remainder of Baton Rouge, immediately creating a $53 million budget shortfall. The study also raised concerns as to whether the remaining portions of Baton Rouge, Louisiana’s state capital, would be able to support public services despite the loss of tax revenue. As the tables below shows projected figures for St. George would create a town with an average income $30,000 higher than present day Baton Rouge, while the unemployment rate would be halved.

There's always been an unwritten rule that, if in a committed relationship, thou shalt not play tonsil-tennis with another person, allow them to put their hands or tongues on your body, nor put their bits anywhere near yours. The equation was simple: sex = infidelity. But now 'cheating' has taken on a whole new meaning, and it's mostly thanks to social media. Emotional infidelity - deep, passionate connections between people who often aren't even aware they've crossed the line from platonic friendship to romantic love - is turning out to be the biggest threat marriage has ever faced. Social media has blurred the definition of 'cheating', and just because you're not actually having sex with someone else doesn't mean you're not being unfaithful to your partner by flirting with other men . Facebook and Twitter, with their 'harmless' online flirtations, never-quite-forgotten old flame reunions and 'friends' who seem to care more about our lives than our partners, have made emotional cheating more possible . Emotional infidelity wasn't part of our grandparents' consciousness because the only member of the opposite sex available to flirt with was either your best friends' husband or your husbands' best friend. Infidelity rose sharply the second women swelled the workforce and expanded the choice of available extra-marital partners. Then along came Facebook and Twitter, and with it 'harmless' online flirtations, never-quite-forgotten old flame reunions ('It's just a coffee') and 'friends' who seem to care more about our lives than our partners. It's no wonder the lines of infidelity have blurred into a messy blob with which Rorschach would have had a heyday. Intense but invisible, erotic but unconsumed - emotional infidelity is dangerous, addictive and way too easy to get away with. With such blurry boundaries, it's hard to know what's acceptable and what's not. Are you an emotional cheat? Answer 'yes' to a few of the following and you're swimming in dangerous waters... Do you act available? The more you talk about your partner to others, the less available you'll seem . Do you share intimate details of your life with people you fancy? It's one thing dissecting relationships with same sex friends (or opposite sex friends if you're gay) but another discussing personal things with someone you've got a 'thing' for . It's usually women who are guilty of emotional cheating, since women get more emotionally involved and are keen to test it out, to see if this could be better than her current situation .

Eight questions to see if you are being emotionally unfaithful . Do you talk negatively about your partner to a 'special' friend? You're effectively saying 'I could be lured away from this relationship because it's not ideal'. Do you act available? The more you talk about your partner to others, the less available you'll seem. Conveniently forget to mention you're involved with someone and people will react to you as though you're single. Do you have one rule for you, one rule for them? We all want our cake and to eat it too though we justify this by saying if we're flirting with someone, we know it's innocent. We're also very good at deluding ourselves something's innocent when it's not. Do you regularly indulge in sexual fantasies about someone else? I don't actually think there's anything intrinsically wrong with being unfaithful in your head, but some experts say fantasy sex can make you want the person even more. The whole point of fantasies, after all, is to conjure up brilliantly perfect sex! Do you keep secrets? Do you have secret email accounts, passwords and a lock on your phone? In an open, honest relationship, ideally no communication should be secret. Do you share intimate details of your life with people you fancy? It's one thing dissecting and analyzing your relationships with same sex friends (or opposite sex friends if you're gay) but quite another discussing deeply personal things with someone you've got a 'thing' for. Emotional closeness swiftly moves into romantic dependence. Are you female? It tends to be the woman who pushes the affair from friendship to love, from fantasy to actuality, according to psychologists. Women get more emotionally involved and are keen to test it out, to see if this could be better than her current situation. Do you lie to your partner about seeing other people? If your partner's feeling a little threatened by the amount of time you're spending with your new best 'friend', do you continue seeing them and lie? A good question to ask to keep you on the straight and narrow: If my partner saw me right now, would they be upset? Would you be tempted to lie about what you're doing? If yes, stop it!"

A Kansas man ate pizza, smoked marijuana and watched almost two episodes of 'Game of Thrones' with his partner before remembering his 10-month-old foster daughter was still inside a sweltering car, authorities said. Seth Jackson, 29, faces a first-degree murder charge in the July 24 death in Wichita. No charges have been filed against his partner, who has been identified as Payton Schroeder. Jackson remembered the girl after hearing a child's cries on the HBO program, Schroeder told police, according to an affidavit obtained by Kansas.com. They reportedly watched one-and-a-half episodes. Police say the girl was inside the car with the windows up for more than two hours. It was around 90 degrees outside. An autopsy showed she died of hyperthermia due to heat exposure. Scroll down for video . Foster father: Seth Jackson, pictured, reportedly smoked marijuana and watched Game of Thrones before remembering his foster daughter was inside a hot car for two hours . Victim: Kadillak Poe Jones was reportedly in the sweltering car for two hours while her foster got high and watched the HBO fantasy drama . The girl has been identified by local media as Kadillak Poe Jones. Police have not released her name, however, and documents in the case only use her initials. The affidavit says Schroeder told police that Jackson called that day to let him know he would be picking Kadillak up from the baby sitter after taking their 5-year-old adopted child to a doctor's appointment. Jackson told police that when he arrived home, he locked the car and went inside with his 5-year-old and pizza he had picked up. Schroeder revealed to investigators that he and Jackson smoked marijuana that Jackson had earlier picked up that day, according to the affidavit. Scene: When officers arrived, Jackson still on the phone, making calls and repeatedly stating, 'I left her in the car, she's dead, she's dead' Professional: Jackson, right, reportedly picked up marijuana the day Kadillak died . Both men said they ran to the car to retrieve Kadillak and call authorities. Schroeder told investigators Kadillak was hot and stiff when she was taken from the car and carried into the house. As he called 911, Jackson attempted CPR but could not get the child's mouth open, according to the affidavit filed by Wichita police detective Ryan Schomaker. Officers who responded found Jackson still on the phone when they arrived, making calls and repeatedly stating, 'I left her in the car, she's dead, she's dead,' according to the affidavit. Meanwhile, Kadillak was unresponsive and lying on her back on the couch. Firefighters moved her from the couch to the floor once they arrived and attempted to revive her. Family: In addition to Kadillak, whom they were trying to adopt, Jackson and his partner had five other children in their care. They had three other foster children ages 3, 5 and 18, and two adopted children ages 5 and 7 . Couple: Jackson, left, is seen with partner Payton Schroeder, right. Jackson reportedly works for the Wichita school district . Later in an interview at police headquarters, Schroeder told detectives he and Jackson had been foster parents to Kadillak since she was 2 weeks old. Although the girl died of hyperthermia, Sedgwick County District Attorney Marc Bennett said the first-degree murder charge was warranted because the child died during the commission of an inherently dangerous felony, aggravated endangering of a child. The case is not charged as intentional murder. In addition to Kadillak, whom they were trying to adopt, Jackson and Schroeder had five other children in their care. They had three other foster children ages 3, 5 and 18, and two adopted children ages 5 and 7. The two younger foster children were visiting other relatives at the time the 10-month-old died. Jackson's Facebook account lists him as a paraprofessional for the Wichita school district. Familiar: Jackson remembered Kadillak was in the car after hearing a child cry on Game of Thrones . 'It always struck me he had empathy, compassion and patience with the students,' former substitute teacher Tom Fleming recently told KWCH. 'It just struck me, what a big heart, 5-6 kids at home and you're student teaching which you actually don't get paid for."" The Kansas Department of Children and . Families (DCF) said in a July 30 statement 'We remain deeply saddened . that this child suffered such a horrific death.

e4f821de617786a65081aa4c4bc18430be54b53a,"Patients face either paying for some treatments or going without if the NHS fails to close a £30billion black hole in its budget, its experts have warned. They have refused to rule out charges if the health service cannot be run cheaper – or receives extra money from the Government. It came after a report by the head of the NHS Simon Stevens warned that the health service would have an annual deficit of £30billion by 2020/21. Patients may have to start paying for non-urgent procedures and even to make GP appointments if costs are not cut, experts have warned . But estimates show that even if it makes unprecedented cost-savings, it will still need an extra £8billion from the Government. David Bennett, chief executive of Monitor, the NHS financial watchdog, refused to rule out charging patients if this money is not forthcoming. And the NHS’s most senior doctor Professor Bruce Keogh said that it was crucial that the NHS closes the funding gap for services to remain free of charge. He said: ‘The money will be a big issue. 'But in my mind the real issue is the immeasurable value of living in a society where you, your family, your neighbours can get high quality, modern care without having to worry about money when you’re already anxious and in pain.’ Previously, other health experts have warned that in future patients may be forced to pay up to £10 for a GP appointment, or £75 for a night in a hospital bed. Professor Bruce Keogh said funding would be an issue if changes were not made . They include Rob Webster, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, who earlier this month said bosses would have to ‘think the unthinkable’. Doctors have also suggested patients will have to pay for some non-urgent procedures such as hip and knee replacement and cataract surgery or go without. The NHS’s annual budget is currently £110billion a year and this amount has been ring-fenced from the public spending cuts which have hit other departments in the past five years. But it needs much more money to cater for ever increasing costs of treating the ageing and more obese population. Mr Stevens’ report contained a series of key recommendations to save the NHS money in the long-term by preventing patients becoming ill and providing care more cheaply. These include recruiting an army of volunteers to carry out tasks such as feeding patients in hospital or looking after them at home in return for getting £200 off their council tax bill. Other measures will see GPs and doctors carrying out consultations by email or webcam particularly for frail patients with long-term conditions. Mr Stevens also urged employers to offer cash prizes or vouchers to help staff lose weight to tackle obesity. But even if these plans are implemented, it is estimated the NHS will still need an extra £8billion of funding from the Government. This is to meet the ever-growing costs of caring for the ageing and more obese population succumbing to long-term illnesses such as heart disease and dementia. Mr Stevens said the NHS was ‘at a crossroads’, adding: ‘We have no choice but to do this. If we do it, a better NHS is possible; if we don’t the consequences for patients will be severe.’ Yesterday Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the Government, if re-elected next year, could provide the needed funding but the NHS would also have to make efficiency savings. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he could provide the extra funding if the Conservatives were elected in May but that the Service needed to make efficiency savings . Speaking on BBC News, he added the Conservatives were committed to ‘protecting and increasing’ funding in real terms. He said: ‘A strong NHS needs a strong economy – then it is possible to increase spending this report calls for. ‘We will need to find greater efficiency savings. It will be tough to do so, and don’t underestimate the challenge.’ Labour has pledged to increase the NHS’s budget by £2.5billion a year on top of inflation – but that money will not arrive until 2017. Health chief's ten-point prescription for reform . The report by chief executive of NHS England Simon Stevens said more money in itself would not be enough to prevent service cuts – major structural reforms are essential. Here the Mail’s Whitehall Correspondent Daniel Martin details the main proposals: . Simon Stevens said changes must be made if the NHS is to continue running in the same way as it has for generations .","NHS will have annual deficit if costs are not lowered, experts warned . Government 'must pay extra £8billion or patients could be charged' Aging and gradually more obese population is adding costs to hospitals . Family doctors should provide more services traditionally provided in hospital. GPs should carry out more scans and tests, to prevent patients having to make so many trips to hospital, and start to employ consultants and psychiatrists. GP surgeries should be set up in hospitals to deal with less acute cases and reduce numbers of the elderly needlessly admitted to wards. With a night in a hospital bed costing hundreds of pounds, this has the potential to save huge sums. Major structural change for urgent care services, to ensure they work ‘seven days a week’. A&E departments should collaborate with failing out-of-hours services, potentially even being merged. It should be easier for women to give birth outside hospital – a plan which would deliver significant savings. This could involve midwives setting up their own community-based midwifery services. Reform of care homes, to ensure they provide more health services and rehabilitation help after falls. More consultations with doctors should take place on email and via webcam. This would save people the trouble of trailing to hospital and also because it is a more efficient use of money. Specialist services – such as heart operations – should be centralised to ensure the quality of care is maintained. At present, there are too many centres, which is costly for the NHS. People who volunteer in hospitals, or to care for the elderly in their homes, should receive council tax discounts of up to £200. NHS cash should go to companies so they can reward staff who lose weight with shopping vouchers and prizes. Councils should play their part on health, such as curbs on junk food outlets, so people do not end up in hospital in the first place. And underpinning all this is the hope that the public will start to take more responsibility for their own health. Mr Stevens warns only by losing weight, giving up smoking and doing more exercise will the numbers ending up in hospital go down."
100dcc50ee78785bd5f5962f06f1b6e154d7abf6,"Scathing: Commissioner Bob Jones claims PCCs have been a £100m waste of money . Elected crime tsars have been a £100million waste of money and spend their time dreaming up gimmicks and clashing with chief constables, one of them admits today. Bob Jones has confessed that in their first year in charge of police forces, Police and Crime Commissioners have neither made them run better nor made the public safer. The Labour PCC for the West  Midlands said their planning was vague and that many of this new breed of politicians, who earn up to £100,000, had remained generally unknown rather than building public confidence. In a withering assessment published to coincide with the first anniversary of the PCCs’ election, Mr Jones gave the flagship law and order reform ‘four out of ten’ overall and condemned it as ‘£100 million spent so far on making police accountability less effective’. His comments provoked anger from Policing Minister Damian Green, who said: ‘Across the country, Police and Crime Commissioners are driving reform and holding their forces to account. And it’s the public who’ll decide how well they’ve  performed - at the ballot box.’ In his ‘school report’, Mr Jones gave PCCs three out of ten for cutting crime, claiming the rate is now, at best, flat, and at worst rising again after years of decline. The lowest grade, two out of ten, came in the category of public confidence. ‘With record low turnout at the election, record levels of hostile publicity, record numbers of investigations into PCCs and clashes between chief constables and PCCs etc, there is not much evidence PCCs have led to more confidence in policing or the governance of policing,’ said Mr Jones. Bad choice: Kent PCC Ann Barnes, left, and then Youth Commissioner Paris Brown, right, who stepped down from the role after making offensive comments on Twitter . He gave scores of four out of ten for drawing up budgets and plans, writing: ‘PCCs have had to cope with Government funding reductions. However, some have not helped the situation by introducing gimmicks and there are serious questions about the sustainability of some budgets.’ PCCs were brought in across England and Wales last November by the Conservatives to set budgets and decide on strategies while also holding chief constables to account. But lack of enthusiasm for the reform among Liberal Democrats meant the polls were held with little publicity, and a record low 15 per cent of voters turned out. Anger: Policing Minister Damian Green said PCCs are 'driving reform' and 'holding their forces to account' Some keen to stand were barred by strict rules and the Tories managed to convince only very few ex-military chiefs and business leaders to stand. Since the election PCCs have become embroiled in a series of  scandals, including: .","Bob Jones says Police and Crime Commissioners are a waste of money . Claims they have neither cut crime, nor boosted public confidence . PCCs were brought in across England and Wales last November . Kent’s independent crime tsar Ann Barnes appointed Paris Brown as the first ‘youth commissioner’ without carrying out basic checks that would have revealed that the teenager had made offensive comments online. Cumbria’s Tory PCC Richard Rhodes took two chauffeur-driven trips to meetings, costing taxpayers £700, and when the news was leaked to a local paper, the whistleblower was arrested. PCCs in Gwent and Lincolnshire forced out their chief constables. In each force only one person applied to take over the top job. At least a dozen PCCs handed out well-paid deputy roles to friends and allies without advertising them. Four PCCs have already been investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission for alleged criminal misconduct. Lancashire’s Clive Grunshaw is facing charges, while Durham’s Ron Hogg is still under investigation. Several PCCs have caused controversy over expenses. Just this week it emerged that Norfolk’s Stephen Bett had declared his home as his place of work, allowing him to claim mileage for driving to the force HQ. He has agreed to repay £3,000."
ae7c4f25e3054fb935c8ff20e23a51073ad653d3,"The capture of the most wanted sub-atomic particle in physics was today named as Science journal's Breakthrough of the Year. Scientists had been chasing the Higgs boson, nicknamed the 'God particle' for more than four decades. In July the team from the European nuclear research facility at Cern in Geneva announced the detection of a particle that fitted the description of the elusive Higgs. Top breakthrough: A representation of traces of traces of a proton-proton collision measured in the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experience in the search for the Higgs boson . The boson is believed to give matter mass via an associated 'Higgs field' that permeates space. Without the property of mass, the universe we live in could not exist. Scientists used the world's biggest atom smashing machine, the £2.6billion Large Hadron Collider on the Swiss-French border, to track down the missing particle. Finding the Higgs topped the list of most important discoveries of 2012 released today by Science, one of the world's most prestigious scientific journals. The particle was first proposed by a British physicist Professor Peter Higgs almost 50 years ago when he was a 34-year-old scientist working at the University of Edinburgh. Emotional moment: Professor Peter Higgs appears to wipe away a tear after scientists at the Large Hadron Collider claim to have possibly discovered a particle believed to be the Higgs boson . But until this year, no-one had been able to prove that his theory was right. Science news journalist Adrian Cho, who wrote about the discovery in the journal's latest issue, said: 'Mass must somehow emerge from interactions of the otherwise mass-less particles themselves. that's where the Higgs comes in. 'Just as an electric field consists of particles called photons, the Higgs field consists of Higgs bosons woven into the vacuum. Physicists have now blasted them out of the vacuum and into brief existence.' Science also lists nine other pioneering achievements from 2012. Curiosity coming into land on Mars: The rover's landing system was another scientific achievement hailed by the journal in its end-of-year round up . Brain-machine interface: Jan Scheuermann, a 52 year-old woman who was diagnosed with a degenerative brain disorder 13 years ago, using a mechanical arm controlled by her brain to feed herself .","Scientists had hunting for evidence of the Higgs boson for over 40 years . Physicists using found it using Cern's £2.6billion atom smasher . Journal Science also lists nine runners up . The Denisovan Genome: Scientists sequenced the DNA blueprint of the Denisovans, an extinct species of human that lived alongside Neanderthals and the ancestors of people living today. Making Eggs From Stem Cells: Japanese researchers showed that embryonic stem cells from mice could be coaxed into becoming viable egg cells. Curiosity's Landing System: Mission engineers at the American space agency Nasa safely and precisely placed the Curiosity rover on the surface of Mars. They used a 'sky crane' that dropped the 3.3 ton rover to the surface from a hovering platform on three cables. X-ray Laser Provides Protein Structure: Researchers used an X-ray laser, which shines a billion times brighter than traditional synchrotron sources, to determine the structure of an enzyme required by the parasite that causes African sleeping sickness. The advance demonstrated the potential of X-ray lasers to decipher proteins that conventional X-ray sources cannot. Precision Engineering of Genomes: The revision and deletion of DNA in higher organisms has generally been hit-or-miss. In 2012, a tool known as TALENs, which stands for 'transcription activator-like effector nucleases,' allowed scientists to alter or inactivate specific genes in animals such as zebra fish and toads, and cells from patients with disease. Majorana Fermions: The existence of Majorana fermions, particles that act as their own antimatter and annihilate themselves, has been debated for more than seven decades. This year, a team of physicists and chemists in the Netherlands provided the first solid evidence that such exotic matter exists, in the form of quasi-particles. These are groups of interacting electrons that behave like single particles. The ENCODE Project: A decade-long study reported this year in more than 30 papers revealed that the human genetic code is more functional than researchers had believed. Although just 2% of the genome codes for actual proteins, the Encyclopaedia of DNA Elements, or ENCODE, project indicated that about 80% of it is active in ways such as helping to switch genes on or off. Brain-Machine Interfaces: Scientists showed that paralysed human patients could move a mechanical arm with their minds and perform complex movements in three dimensions. The technology is still experimental, and costly, but the team is hopeful that one day it will help patients paralysed by strokes, spinal injuries and other conditions. Neutrino Mixing Angle: Hundreds of researchers working on the Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment in China found the last part of the jigsaw describing how particles known as neutrinos morph from one strain or 'flavour' to another as they travel at near-light speed. Neutrinos may someday help researchers to explain why the universe contains so much matter and so little antimatter."

Michael Jackson could still be alive if six 'extreme deviations' in his treatment had been avoided, a court heart yesterday. Cardiologist Dr Alon Steinberg listed six flaws in Conrad Murray's treatment in Los Angeles Superior Court which had a direct impact on the 50-year-old 'Thriller' star's death. Prompted by prosecutors, he described Murray's 'bizarre' behaviour in trying to revive Jackson after he stopped breathing on June 25, 2009, and his catalogue of elementary blunders in caring for the star. On Wednesday a jury heard how Conrad Murray made a series of obvious errors in the minutes before Michael Jackson died . He told the court that Murray: . Cardiologist Dr. Alon Steinberg detailed numerous errors, including wrongly administered CPR, failure to call 911, misusing Propofol and not having proper medical equipment . 'All these extreme deviations, giving Propofol in the wrong setting without proper equipment or personnel, not making proper preparations, not calling 911 in a timely manner, not keeping records, all directly impacted on Mr Jackson's life,' said the cardiologist. 'When you monitor a patient you never leave their side, especially after giving them Propofol. It's like leaving a baby that's sleeping on your kitchen counter top. More... Jury shown photo of Michael Jackson's naked dead body and hear how daughter Paris sobbed about being an orphan . 'You would never do it because there is a chance the baby could wake up and fall off or grab a knife or something. You just don't do it. 'If these deviations didn't happen, Mr Jackson could have been alive.' Murray, 58, has pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter by administering Jackson a lethal dose of Propofol to help him sleep. But Dr Steinberg listed the medical equipment Murray should have had on hand for dealing with a potential emergency. Murray tried giving one-handed chest compressions to Jackson as he lay on the bed, instead of using two hands on a hard surface. Either way Murray was wrong as Jackson still had a pulse when he began . They included equipment for checking his heart rate, his oxygen levels, a back-up battery, a backboard for CPR, a defibrillator to shock the heart, life-saving drugs and trained assistants. 'It is basic knowledge in America that when someone is down you need to call 911 for help. One of the first things Dr Murray should have done was call 911. There was a significant delay,' he said. The cardiologist criticised Murray for calling an assistant rather than an ambulance.  'Every minute counts,' he added. He added that he'd never heard of Propofol being used outside a hospital. Dr Steinberg was testifying after Dr Christopher Rogers, the Los Angeles Deputy Medical Examiner, insisted Jackson could not have killed himself by self-administering Propofol. He told jurors that the circumstances of Jackson's death didn't support the claim by Murray's lawyers that the singer was to blame for his own death. 'In order for Mr Jackson to have administered the Propofol to himself, you would have to assume he woke up and although he was under the influence of Propofol and other sedatives, he was somehow able to administer Propofol to himself,' said Dr Rogers. 'Then he stops breathing and all this takes place in a two-minute period of time. To me, that scenario seems less reasonable.' Jackson could have survived had 911 been called, experts testified, who also said there is no way the pop star could have given himself the lethal dose of sedatives . Murray's lawyer, Michael Flanagan told the judge the defense was dropping the claim that Jackson may have swallowed a deadly dose of Propofol to cause his own death. Dr Steinberg insisted that Jackson's life could have been saved if Murray called 911 the moment he discovered the star's breathing had stopped. 'He was definitely savable at that point. There was a delay in calling 911. If they had got there six minutes later Mr Jackson would still be alive,' said the cardiologist. 'He had a heart pressure and the heart was getting excited and there wasn't enough oxygen. If he had all the help and equipment that he didn't have, Dr Murray could probably have saved Mr Jackson at that point. 'He should never have started chest compressions. He should have called 911.

VIDEO Scroll down to watch Roy Hodgson talk about how he will continue leading England . Slot: Emile Heskey scores to make it 5-1 to England against Germany after a Michael Owen hat-trick . Celebrations: Sol Campbell (left), Steven Gerrard (centre) and Ashley Cole during the 5-1 win over Germany . Oops: The historic 5-1 win in 2001 seems a long time ago from the current German outfit . Remember that? The back and front page of the Mail on Sunday led on England's 5-1 thrashing of Germany . The Germans remember it well, too, because they used that defeat to inspire a transformation that would lead to them becoming one of the greatest sides in the world. They didn’t blame the players for losing, they realised that the system was wrong and they changed the system. We need to do the same thing. We have to stop blaming players like Wayne Rooney and Steven Gerrard... there was talk about how they had lost heart, they hadn’t given enough for their country. I promise you, this is absolute rubbish. When a player pulls on an England shirt he will do anything to win for his country. But there comes a time when it needs more than heart… it needs a proper structure that enables them to be the greatest team they can. Germany provided that structure and look what has happened.

On the up: England must look at how Germany responded in 2001 and work on improving themselves . There’s no doubt we could do everything Germany did and more, so as you watch the final on Sunday evening, just think: if the FA choose to learn the lessons of this World Cup, it will be England who we are watching in the final in future, not Germany. Glum: England must take responsibility for youth development as Germany did after the 5-1 humiliation .

Roy Hodgson, England and the FA must do the same after 2014 World Cup . Germany have 34,970 UEFA (Pro, A or B) licensed coaches compared to just 2,769 in England . We need to get our priorities straight - the game starts at grassroots . Youth development needs looking at because the national team is suffering . Do this, and we'll be in the World Cup final in the future like Germany are . They introduced more and better coaching. Ten years on from that 2001 defeat, England had 2,769 UEFA (Pro, A or B) licensed coaches compared to 34,970 in Germany. England need more coaches and more highly-qualified coaches working at all levels of the game. They made sure there was more game time for young players. Young players in German academies have roughly five times the game time that those in English academies have. The grass-roots game is where footballing greatness starts. We have to get our youth football right. They made sure there was a clearly defined route between the grassroots and the national game, so that good players were fast-tracked into the senior set-up. We need to make sure this is happening in England, too. A proper structure means we keep talented players in the game. They made sure they took responsibility for youth development and the future of the Germany team. It feels as if that task has been handed to club academies and centres of excellence in this country, which means there is not an England development programme but club development programmes. This is fine but it means the importance of winning games at a young age comes at the expense of developing technique and it means that if the clubs get it wrong, the England team suffer. The FA need to take more control. In Germany they sorted out what their footballing philosophy was. They were clear about what they wanted from players and how to achieve it. There needs to be an FA philosophy on how to develop players. What is the FA’s philosophy on the game? Most people think that a more technical, possession-based game has been lacking in English football. Are the FA addressing this? What is being done? The FA need to instill a football intelligence in young players and this needs to be reflected in every side from the first team to the Under 16s, so the players understand the England way of playing."
117bdec9d777eb7ad605fd73201b42eb520701e1,"William Shakespeare famously penned the wisdom that a rose by any other name would smell as sweet. So what exactly is in a name? Apparently quite a bit, at least according to this list compiled by Kidspot, detailing the most definitive monikers likely to brand your child a 'bogan'. But first, a definition. bogan/ˈboʊgən/ (say ‘bohguhn) noun Colloquial (mildly derogatory) 1. a person, generally from an outer suburb of a city or town from a lower socio-economic background, viewed as uncultured; originally typified as wearing ugg boots and tights, or footy shorts and thongs in public and having a mullet hairstyle. Scroll down for video . The bogan baby-a new phenomena for Australia? Endearingly and embarrassing ingrained into Australian culture, the bogan is a familiar figure at the local pub, wearing footy shorts and thongs, or a bejewelled matching tracksuit and poorly disguised hair extensions. A harmless and often entertaining local legend, the bogan is as much a part of the nation's image as BBQ's and beaches. But is the cultural legend of the ever-present bogan possessive of characteristics a parent would want for their new child? Whilst parents can often be overwhelmed when searching for potential names for their progeny, it is best to choose wisely. A baby's sobriquet is, after all, branded onto birth certificates for all eternity. What does a name say about a person, or mean for a baby's future? It can seem safe to settle on a compromise of a traditional name spelled a new way, or to call a child after a person or place which evokes hopes for the future, but what do the names really mean for a new baby? Guru's of Aussie culture Kath and Kim poked fun at the prolific trend of creating a unique baby name. Baby Epponnee-Ray was the butt of many commentators jokes, as was the intention. And it seems that no young girl is complete without her very own apostrophe these days. Chris Lilley's Jai'me can attest to that, and with names such as Princ'ess making the cut, one can only wonder where the symbol might work its way into. As the list, which pokes fun at quite offensively and outrageously bogan titles, proves, getting adventurous with baby names may be fun, but perhaps not always wise. Chris Lilley's creation Jai'me King: ""It's spelled like Jaime, but I added the apostrophe"" Boys: . 1. Afernee . 2. Ashtyn . 3. Beejay . 4. Cruz . 5. Haze . 6. Holden . 7. Kash . 8. Storm . 9. Tyson . 10. Zaiden . Girls: . 1. Caprice . 2. Cheyenne . 3. Jorja . 4. Mercedes . 5. Nevaeh . 6. Princ’ess . 7. Rybekkah . 8. Shiraz . 9. Skylah . 10. Vegas . Recently, various spellings of common names such as Brittney and Mikayla, or Jacob and Jason, have all paved the way for names which make the list such as Jorja (Georgia). Mercedes, Cruz, Holden and Vegas all seem to fall into an 'aspirational' category of wanting fame, fortune, or glamour for one's child. So here is a selection of the top names, with commentary from Kidspot included (try not to laugh). Kash, Vegas, Tyson, Prin'cess and more bogan baby names! The Victorian Registry of Births Deaths and Marriages recorded that there were 6,932 unique girls names and 5,965 unique boys names registered in 2013. Jackson was a unique name growing in popularity, with 199 baby boys given the name last year. There were varied spellings of Jackson, with 140 boys were named Jaxon and 32 named Jaxson.  For girls, Isabella was a popular choice for girls with 332 plus variations including Bellas, Isobels, Mabels and Arabellas. Director and Registrar Erin Keleher noted that parents choose names for a range of reasons including honouring their family, tradition and popular culture, the Registry's website said. Whilst a bogan baby name is not a death sentence, and may even be a convenient conversation starter as the children get older, these names will certainly draw attention and probably questions. Winning gold in this particular event, which classifies as almost Olympian in the gymnastic-like contortions of regular names, is perhaps not something to aim for after all. How have you chosen your children's names? Making a name unique can be tough- so many parents settle for unique spelling instead .","Hilarious names for new babies . Misspellings, apostrophes, and more! Does your child's name make the top of the bogan list? What does a name mean for a baby's future? Caprice: French for “impulsive change of mind”, Caprice recalls a shiny Holden sedan and a clear-stilettoed stripper all at once. Not the classiest associations to be made with your daughter, but each to their own. Anfernee: When you take an entirely respectable name like Anthony and deform it so it sounds like you’re missing your front teeth, you gots to be bogan. Kash: Ah, a misspell of the already mega-bogan, money-grubbing name Cash. You’d better be ready for a massive five-finger dollar-sign ring and a gold tooth on this kid. Vegas: While it’s been a tight race down this list, I do believe that naming your baby girl after the cheapest, tawdriest, most debaucherous city in the world takes the bogan cake. Tyson: Sure, why not name your child after a bad-ass boxer with a face tattoo who did hard time for an unspeakable crime (allegedly)? Oh, but use his last name ‘cause dats mo’ bad-ass than plain ol’ “Mike”. Princ’ess: As if naming your daughter Princess isn’t bad enough, you also feel the need to insert a completely random apostrophe in the middle of it? Similar specimens include D’Lilah and Al’xandra, but at least the apostrophe actually replaces a letter in these cases. (NB: that’s what apostrophes do)."

The Mail on Sunday’s investigation shows how MPs, Lords and lobbyists who benefit from green policies also advise the Government on how those policies ought to operate. The result is that the debate over measures of questionable value but enormous cost has been almost silenced. Only three MPs voted against the 2008 Climate Change Act, whose legally binding emissions targets make it the most radical piece of economic legislation in recent history. The present Energy Bill – which will increase renewable energy subsidies to new, eyewatering heights – is backed by all the main parties. Behind this apparent unanimity lies an extraordinary blurring of the boundaries which normally exist between business, politics, academics and campaigners. Top civil servants frequently work one year for the Government and the next for lobbyists, trying to influence their former colleagues. MPs who play major role in energy debates - but are in the pay of green companies . Lord Oxburgh has directorships with Green Energy Options Ltd and clean energy firm 2OC - which he declared. But he failed to reveal his role with another green firm, the Real Asset Energy Fund . The conflicted House of Lords... where peers don't have to state how much they are paid . Lobbyists who bid for green funds - but advise ministers on green policyOne of most influential green lobby groups is E3G – Third Generation Environmentalists. Its London branch and its offshoot Transform UK first conceived and then successfully lobbied for the Green Investment Bank, now spending £3.8 billion of taxpayers’ money, much of it to fund offshore wind – yet another subsidy on top of the levies on bills. Its leadership is the Who’s Who of ecocrats. Chief executive Nick Mabey was responsible for energy in Tony Blair’s No 10 strategy unit; at E3G he replaced John Ashton, who left to become the UK’s chief climate negotiator, serving three successive Foreign Secretaries, Labour and Coalition. He is back at E3G as a ‘founding director’. James Cameron, chairman of Climate Change Capital, advises the Treasury and was a member of the Prime Minister's Business Advisory Group until last year. He was a member of the commission which set up the Green Investment Bank . The specialist green private equity funds... that are very well connectedSpecialist green private equity funds also have a huge web of links. For example, James Cameron, chairman of Climate Change Capital, advises the Treasury and was a member of the Prime Minister’s Business Advisory Group until last year. He was a member of the commission which set up the Green Investment Bank. Cameron is on the board of Oxford University’s Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment. There his former Climate Change Capital colleague Ben Caldecott directs the Stranded Assets Programme – an academic project aiming to prove that fossil fuel reserves will have to be left in the ground in order to save the planet, currently a growing demand from green campaigns. Caldecott moonlights as head of government advisory – in other words lobbying – at Bloomberg New Energy Finance. While he was still at Climate Change Capital, he worked on secondment at DECC and as a climate policy adviser for the Conservative Party. The scope of this green elite makes airing objections almost impossible. Last week, questioned at the Commons Energy Select Committee, even Energy Secretary and Climate Change Secretary Ed Davey admitted that Britain’s green policies had increased global CO2 emissions – because by increasing the price of energy, they have driven jobs to countries like China, which use coal heavily and have no binding emissions limits. ‘It is certainly arguable that our carbon footprint is bigger,’ he said.

Tim Yeo, chairman of the Energy and Climate Change Select Committee, has received well over £400,000 from green energy firms since 2009. Barry Gardiner, a Labour member of Yeo’s committee, has received nearly £60,000 since 2008 from Globe International – an international group chaired by Lord Deben, who is also chair of the Fovernment Climate Change Committee (CCC). Globe campaigns to get national parliaments to pass green laws. Charles Hendry was Energy Minister until 2012. He is chairman of Forewinds, which is planning the world’s biggest offshore windfarm. This role was vacated by Deben when he became chairman of the CCC. For this Hendry is paid £48,000, plus £18,000 from Atlantic Supergrid, which wants to lay a high-voltage cable between Britain and Iceland. In all, he is raking in £66,000 a year, more than his MP’s salary. Lord Oxburgh moved the amendment to the Energy Bill which sought to impose the 2030 carbon limit that will cut CO2 emissions from electric power by 90 per cent. He has directorships with Green Energy Options Ltd and clean energy firm 2OC – which he declared. But he failed to reveal his role with another green firm, the Real Asset Energy Fund. This has led to an investigation by the Lords Commissioner for Standards. Oxburgh also advises Climate Change Capital, one of the biggest green investment firms. Lord Maclennan of Rogart is chairman of renewable energy firm Inwatur. Together with Lord Lewis and Lord Cameron of Dillington, he was one of three co-authors of a report in May by the Lords EU Committee demanding bigger increases in low-carbon spending who declared interests in renewables. Few environmentalists have had careers as prodigious as E3G’s chairman, Tom Burke – inventor of the slogan ‘green growth’. Having been executive director of Friends Of The Earth and director of the Green Alliance, he moved into Government, as special adviser to three Environment Secretaries, and then into business, as a green adviser to BP and Rio Tinto. Remarkably he is now also the senior climate change adviser to the Foreign Office. E3G’s funders reflect its chairman’s diverse interests. They include four Government departments: those for International Development, the Environment, DECC and the Foreign Office – which means taxpayers are funding a lobby group whose actions make them poorer. E3G also gets money from Greenpeace and the World Wildlife Fund. Another powerful lobby is Renewable UK. Maf Smith, its deputy chief executive, previously worked at DECC on changes to renewable subsidies enshrined in the Energy Bill."

A sightseer who tried to get a close-up view of one of Yellowstone's most well-known attractions could end up damaging it for years to come after he crashed a drone into the 160-degree waters. The Grand Prismatic Spring owes its brilliant array of colors to a delicate balance of bacteria and algae mixing with special minerals in the harsh environment. Park officials fear that the drone, which plunked into the steaming cauldron last Saturday, might upset that balance. Furthermore, going into 120-foot-deep spring to retrieve the device could cause even more damage. The incident at Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming is one of the most extreme examples of the misuse of drones at the National Park - but it's far from the only one. The National Park Service banned all drones at parks in June after numerous complains that they were disrupting patrons. Scroll down for video . Brilliant: National Park Service officials worry that the drone that crashed into the Grand Prismatic Spring could damage the delicate balance of bacteria that creates at beautiful color . But the rule change hasn't stopped some of pilots who practice America's newest hobby. 'We had not seen any significant activity until this summer. This is a new phenomenon for us in Yellowstone,' Yellowstone spokesman Al Nash told MailOnline. Both before and after the rule change, Park officials have been hearing from visitors that drones are disrupting their experience at the nation's national wonders. Park Service spokesman Jeffrey Olson detailed several instances in the last several months, including: . Flying drones has become a rapidly-growing hobby in the United States as models become cheaper and more widely available (stock image) Mr Olson said the Park Service banned the use of drones on 400 parks and refuges while agency looks at adopting rules for flying them. Either way, they likely won't be allow in Yellowstone or other marquee parks. 'We do think they’re going to be appropriate for some places,' Mr Olson told MailOnline. 'Not in the Zions, the Yellowstones and the Yosemites, those kind of iconic landscapes - probably not.' Despite the nuisance that visitors are reporting, in Yellowstone, at least, officials are doing nothing to educate visitors that drones are banned. There are no signs posted at the park and the semi-annual park newspaper that lists major rules and regulations doesn't include a ban on drones, Mr Nash said. Meanwhile, parks officials are still investigating the crash at the Grand Prismatic Spring. They have not been able to spot the drone from the shore of the lake, which is about one and a half acres. Mr Nash said rangers are considering flying a helicopter over the spring to see if they can spot the drone.","Park rangers fear the drone could upset the delicate balance of algae, bacteria and minerals that gives the Grand Prismatic Spring it brilliant color .

eb7f245f3a0381093a206ece28a3c43a3e4bbd5d,"By . Tracey Cox . Are there ways to help you and your partner orgasm at the same time? The myth of the simultaneous orgasm is still clutching onto the bed sheets tenaciously - and judging by the amount of couples on telly still moaning 'Yes! Yes! Yes!' in unison, it's going to hang on there for some time yet. The reality is, you'd be hard pressed to find the same scene recreated in bedrooms at home because couples rarely climax together. Let's take a look at the facts. Roughly 75% of men in relationships always have an orgasm with their partner, compared to 30% of women. Men's orgasms last around 5-10 seconds (if he's lucky), women's orgasms can last 15 seconds or more (much more, if she's lucky and he's adept). Do the math and you'll soon see the chances of both of you orbiting into orgasmic ecstasy at exactly the same moment is highly unlikely. Romantic, yes. Likely, no. Quite frankly, taking turns - you have your orgasm first, he has his later - is not only more practical, it's sometimes a lot more satisfying. Having an orgasm is a selfish experience: you're totally and utterly fixated on your own pleasure. Having to pay attention to your partner's bits to guarantee they're enjoying themselves at exactly the same moment doesn't enhance the experience, it interferes with it . For men, this is less of a problem. Their orgasms are easier to trigger and once triggered, continue. Women's require a lot more attention and, unless tended from start to finish, can halt or merely trickle away halfway through. While he's twitching and moaning with orgasmic joy, we're often twitching and moaning with resentment at having been robbed at the last moment. Yes simultaneous orgasm can be an incredibly bonding moment but you're still better off making it a pleasant bonus rather than an aim. Women's require a lot more attention and, unless tended from start to finish, can halt or merely trickle away halfway through . 'The best tip I could possibly give you to achieve simultaneous orgasm is to make friends with her vibrator'","Simultaneous orgasms are, largely, a myth . 75% of men always have orgasms during sex, but only 30% of women do . Taking turns is more practical, says leading sex expert Tracey Cox . 'The best tip I could possibly give you to achieve simultaneous orgasm is to make friends with her vibrator' Get him to have an orgasm first and make the 'together' orgasm the second one. Most men find they have much better control second time around. Ignore the old advice of getting him to think about big pants or count backwards. The aim is distraction but it simply doesn't work. New research shows even as he's manically saying '459, 458' in his brain, another part is saying 'What does he think I am, stupid? As if this is going to grab my attention when I've got a pair of breasts bobbling in front of me, my penis is nestled in a nice, warm, sexy place, my girlfriend's moaning and throwing her head back and….' Use the bridge manoeuvre: This is the technique most sex therapists recommend. The basic idea is to give you clitoral stimulation up to the point of, but not actually to, orgasm and let his thrusting trigger off the orgastic reflex. This effectively provides a 'bridge' between clitoral stimulation and intercourse. Choose the right position. Woman on top or him from behind are the most likely positions to stimulate the front vaginal wall and up your chances of a penetrative orgasm. Talk lots, telling each other exactly where you're at by using a number system. Groaning out a 'Nine!' or delivering a curt 'Still two' might seem odd to start, but it's a quick and effective way to communicate in bed. Switch stimulation regularly. Not only will it keep you both hovering rather than climbing steadily toward a climax, it stops sex becoming too orgasm focused. Change positions. Change rooms. Change the CD. Anything to change the mood, keeping it hot and sexy but maintaining a measure of control. Make friends with her vibrator. If you asked me the best tip I could possibly give you to achieve simultaneous orgasm, this would be it. One of you holding a wand vibrator (slim, cylindrical, non-intrusive) over the clitoral area during penetrative sex is the most effective way to ensure a shared orgasm experience."

OK, how about reasonably good sex that left you with a rather smug post-coital glow? Hmm. Then how many of you fantasise more about sleeping in your bed than bouncing around on it? Tracey says that a low libido can effect us all from time to time but there are plenty of ways to get yourself back in the mood . Stressful jobs, fractious relationships, parenting, that monotonous commute - all combine to rob us of desire. If sex is just another chore rather than something you look forward to, chances are one or more of the following is to blame. Pinpoint the problem, then keep reading for some practical solutions. Reasons why you're not frothing at the mouth . Physical . Emotional . Tracey says that even the smallest adjustments such as getting a good night's sleep, can help increase a couple's sex drive . How to get back in the mood: . Get a good night's sleep. Disturbed sleep leads to a reduction in the male hormone testosterone, which boosts both your libidos. Take responsibility for your libido. Don't expect your partner to turn you on, do it yourself! Make it your mission to pinpoint what gets you in the mood for sex then do more of it. Let your imagination loose. Don't be ashamed of your fantasies and refuse to feel guilty if having sex with someone other than your partner is one of them. Being unfaithful in reality isn't on but it's OK to do it in your head. Really. One survey found around 75% of us do it to keep sex fresh. Meet halfway. If you don't want intercourse, what about oral sex? If you don't want oral sex or any sex yourself, do you mind pleasuring them? At the very least, you can and should be able to offer the physical intimacy of a cuddle. Tracey says that it's important to approach the subject rather than avoid it . Focus on sex, don't avoid it. If you're constantly being hassled for it, sex is often the last thing you want to watch or read about. Low libido people often avert their eyes when they see nudity, a sexy scene on telly or in the movies or flip the page if they hit a story in the newspapers or glossies. Don't. It's just as easy to think yourself into sex than it is to talk yourself out of it and the more often you expose yourself to sexy literature and images, the sexier you'll feel. Know what you want and need to be satisfied sexually. And I'm talking both in, and out of, bed. If you need to relax first, don't be scared to ask for a massage. Or for them to do the dishes while you take a bath or shower. Give sex a high priority in your life. If you're avoiding it or not interested, chances are it's the last thing you do, last thing at night. Well – Gosh! – funnily enough, even high sex drive people sometimes wonder if it's worth the effort when they're exhausted after a long day at work. Get into a routine where you and your partner have chat-time then sex before you start dinner and switch the TV on. Or if you really are too stressed during the week, have breakfast in bed on the weekends and make that sex time. Get your body clocks in sync. A morning person matched with a night time one? If this is you, take turns on the time of day you make love. And try sex mid morning, midday and mid afternoon, not just morning or night . Sex does NOT equal intercourse. Plenty of people (women especially) don't orgasm through intercourse alone, so tend to find penetrative sex quite boring. If sex is boring, it's no wonder you're not desperate to dive into bed! The more you mix up what you do, the higher the interest. Don't relax! Instead, focus on the erotic sensations you're feeling. Tighten the muscles of your thighs, bottom, lower tummy and pelvic floor muscles to help trigger an orgasmic reflex. Set up a craving cycle. Without wanting to point out the obvious, orgasms feel good. If something feels good, our body – quite logically – says 'more please' and sulks if we don't obey by developing either psychological or physical cravings when denied its high. The more sex you have, the more you want. We quickly forget how great sex can be. Have good sex often and you're constantly reminded of all the physical and emotional pluses.

cd7f8f60442817c7e9ea7ddcd852d32906521f03,"An Australian body recovered from the Malaysia Airlines MH17 wreckage site had an oxygen mask wrapped around his neck, a Dutch prosecutor has claimed. Wim de Bruin, a spokesman  for the Dutch agency investigating  the incident, has informed the passenger's relatives that a mask was discovered around his neck  but officials are yet to release the Australian's name. He said it was not clear from forensic testing when the mask was applied to the man's face, but its discovery has raised questions that he was conscious after the plane was hit by a missile on July 17 over east Ukraine near the Russian border. Wreckage of flight MH17 is strewn across a field in eastern Ukraine . A body recovered near the wreckage was apparently wearing an oxygen mask, according to a Dutch official . Mr De Bruin said Dutch forensic experts investigated the mask 'for fingerprints, saliva and DNA,' but it did not produce any results, Associated Press reported. It comes as Holland's Foreign Minister Frans Timmermans apologised to the families of MH17 victims for revealing that a passenger was wearing a mask on live TV. It resulted in a flood of phone calls to investigators from the relatives of the 298 passengers and crew who perished, including 38 Australians, seeking more information about the passenger. Mr Timmermans had asked talk-show host Jeroen Pauw whether he was aware that a passenger was wearing a mask on the flight when he said: 'Did you know that someone was found with an oxygen mask over his mouth?' But he apologised  on Thursday, saying: 'I have an enormous amount of sympathy for the next-of-kin,' he said. 'The last thing I want to do is compound their suffering in this way,' The Sydney Morning Herald reported. The Dutch Foreign Minister received international acclaim for a speech he made days after the incident. He suggested that the discovery of the oxygen mask-wearing passenger revealed that at least one person was conscious when the plane was hit by a missile fired by Russian-backed rebels. He also added during the interview that it was unlikely that any of the 298 passengers and crew on board saw the missile approaching. 'No, they did not see the missile coming, but did you know that someone was found with an oxygen mask over his mouth? So someone had the time to to do that,' he said. There was no evidence to conclude that the final moments could not have been as described in his speech at the UN - when he played through scenarios of passengers on the plane.

'Did they lock hands with their loved ones, did they hold their children close to their hearts, did they look each other in the eyes, one final time, in a wordless goodbye? We will never know.' Experts investigating the crash said everyone on board was most likely killed immediately or, if not, became unconscious within seconds. A preliminary report published by the Dutch Safety Board revealed puncture holes in the wreckage suggested small objects penetrated the plane through the cockpit. It was also revealed that holes were found on the cockpit floor and damage to the body was consistent with 'high-energy objects' piercing it from the outside. Forensic experts have so far been unable to recover all bodies from the crash site. About  228 coffins have been flown back to the Netherlands for identification, but some of the coffins contained only partial remains. It is unknown how many bodies remain unaccounted for and only 262 victims have been identified so far.

7649d511aedcc1dbc0862124a017442cb283b01e,"Vindication? Austerity champion George Osborne . The number of people in work hit a record high yesterday – giving another significant pre-election boost to the Tories. Official figures show that there are 1.85million more people in employment now than when the Coalition came to power in May 2010. The economy has bounced back to such an extent that last year an average of 1,600 people found work every day. The Office for National Statistics also revealed that wage growth is outpacing inflation at the fastest rate in almost five years – leaving people with more money in their pockets. The jobs and wages figures came amid a flurry of good economic news: . In an attempt to pour cold water on the positive statistics, Labour claimed too many of the jobs were low paid and pointed to a small rise in youth unemployment. But speaking to workers at a Rolls-Royce plant in West Sussex, Mr Cameron said: ‘We inherited a situation where far too many people were unemployed, where we weren’t creating enough jobs in our country. ‘Since I became Prime Minister, we haven’t solved or tackled all of unemployment, but we have got 1.85million more people in work today than when I became Prime Minister. ‘I sit round that European Union council table with the 27 other countries – I was there last week. Britain, in the last four years, has created more jobs than the rest of Europe put together, so we are on our way.’ On a visit to Felixstowe, Suffolk, today, Mr Cameron will promise a ‘brighter future for hard-working people’ ahead of a speech to business leaders. He will say: ‘Our long-term economic plan is working. I am determined to go further and we will keep working through our plan to secure a brighter future for hard-working people.’ Yesterday’s figures showed that three quarters of all Britons aged 16 to 64 are now in work after the employment rate reached 73.2 per cent. This is the joint highest level since records began in 1971, the same figure having also been achieved in 2004 and 2005. There are now 608,000 more people in employment than a year ago. That is 30.89million people in work compared with 29.04million in April 2010, the last month before the Government came to power. The unemployment rate has also tumbled and is now 5.7 per cent, the lowest in seven years. The UK has the third lowest rate in the European Union, behind only Austria and Germany. The number claiming jobseeker’s allowance fell by 38,600 in January to 823,000, the 27th consecutive monthly fall and the lowest since 2008. Pay rises, excluding bonuses, rose by 1.7 per cent in the year to December, which is lower than last month’s growth of 1.8 per cent, but still more than three times higher than inflation that month of 0.5 per cent. Inflation has since dropped again to 0.3 per cent – a 55-year low – further easing the squeeze on family finances as the cost of living falls. Including bonuses, workers saw a pay rise of 2.1 per cent in the past 12 months, the highest rate since 2011. Confident: Speaking to workers at a Rolls-Royce plant in West Sussex, pictured, Mr Cameron said: 'Britain, in the last four years, has created more jobs than the rest of Europe put together, so we are on our way' John Allan, of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: ‘Many of our members have told us that they intend to expand their businesses and hire staff this year, and so we would expect these positive trends in the headline jobs data to continue in the coming months.’ James Sproule, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said wages would continue to rise as competition for talent intensified. ‘Two thirds of IoD members are planning pay rises at least in line with inflation over the coming months,’ he added. Labour was last night accused of ‘talking down the economy’ by highlighting a small rise in youth unemployment – despite the fact that the overall jobless total fell sharply. The number of 16 to 24-year-olds out of work rose by 3,000 between October and December to 740,000. Labour said the figure was ‘extremely worrying’ – even though youth unemployment has actually fallen by 21 per cent or 198,000 under the Coalition, having risen by nearly 44 per cent under the last Labour government. Tory MP Mark Garnier said: ‘Labour is talking down the economy ... [the party] is proving it is not good for Britain.’","1.85m more people in employment than when Coalition came to power . Wage growth is also outpacing inflation at fastest rate in almost five years . Numbers give another significant pre-election boost to the Conservatives . Inflation has fallen to its lowest rate since the 1960s – just 0.3 per cent; . Shares on the London Stock Exchange have risen to their highest level since the turn of the century, providing a boost to investors and those saving for a pension; . Sterling yesterday hit a seven-year high against the faltering euro. The pound rose above 1.36 euros for the first time since January 2008; . Industrial output is now 1.7 per cent higher than a year ago, including a small but welcome rise in manufacturing. The Prime Minister hailed the economic and employment upturn as vindication of Chancellor George Osborne’s austerity programme, and stressed the need to continue bringing down the deficit."
1c73aeae462806730ce5ee4cedacbffba85a1a1b,"By . Jason Groves . Pascal Soriot, the boss of AstraZeneca, said yesterday that he was willing to consider further bids from Pfizer despite warning MPs that the 'distracting' takeover bid could cost lives . The boss of AstraZeneca last night admitted he would consider selling out to Pfizer if the price increases – just hours after telling MPs the controversial bid could cost lives by delaying the development of anti-cancer drugs. Pascal Soriot, who has branded the  US bid a ‘distraction’ and said it would put lives at risk, also claimed the disruption from the potential deal was ‘manageable’. In an apparent change of tone, he made clear that the AstraZeneca board was willing to consider further bids from its bigger rival. Mr Soriot said: ‘We will consider offers that are made to us in the context of the value, the price that’s offered and the potential of the terms. But certainly the price is a very important dimension.’ He added: ‘We cannot rule out doing a deal because ultimately we have to make sure we represent the interests of our shareholders, and if the price that is offered reflects the full value of the company, of course we would have to make a positive recommendation.’ Yesterday, Mr Soriot had warned MPs that Pfizer’s bid will cost lives by delaying the development of anti-cancer drugs. He told the Commons business select committee that the £63billion deal would be a massive ‘distraction’ that would delay work on life-saving drugs. ‘What will we tell the person whose father died from lung cancer because one of our medicines was delayed because our companies were involved in saving taxes or saving costs?’ he asked MPs. The firm’s research chief Mene Pangalos warned the deal would have a potentially ‘devastating’ impact, with wide-ranging implications for jobs, science and the development of life-saving drugs. Mr Pangalos told the committee that the history of mega-mergers in the drugs industry was that they are ‘very challenging to get through’. Yesterday Ian Reed, the head of Pfizer, was also questioned by MPs but refused to give guarantees on jobs . If the £63billion takeover of Astrazeneca by Pfizer goes, it will be the largest in British corporate history . He added: ‘There are a lot of job losses, there are changes in projects, changes in strategy, changes  in direction. It takes a long time to get through – it can be devastating.’ In a day of major developments: . Yesterday saw tetchy exchanges with MPs on the select committee, which is led by former librarian Adrian Bailey, but there was no  real interrogation of Pfizer’s plans for AstraZeneca, and Mr Read was able to bat away concerns about  its future. There are concerns that Pfizer could be using the takeover of AstraZeneca to strip the company of its assets and cut swathes of staff, concerns Mr Read sought to dismiss . Among the assurances Mr Read gave to MPs was that 20 per cent of the company's combined R&D staff would stay in the UK for at least five years after the deal . Mr Read also dismissed their worries about Pfizer’s reputation as an ‘asset-stripper’, saying it was ‘a company of high integrity’. He also confirmed that jobs would be lost but added: ‘I cannot say how many or where.’ Mr Read insisted that pledges made to ministers – including keeping 20 per cent of the combined firm’s R&D staff in the UK – were ‘legally binding’ and would last for at least five years following the completion of a deal. But MPs raised doubts about weak commitments. Tory MP Brian Binley dismissed Mr Read’s presentation as ‘a lot of sales talk, but short on facts’. Labour’s Willie Bain told Mr Read: ‘There are no commitments of any substance being made.’ Labour leader Ed Miliband yesterday held a 30-minute meeting with Mr Read, but when he emerged from the talks he called for ministers to intervene. He said: ‘There are serious concerns about this takeover. There are too many unanswered questions.’ Treasury sources said Chancellor George Osborne had held a 45-minute meeting with Astra boss  Mr Soriot yesterday afternoon. However, the Institute of Directors cautioned ministers against ‘mounting a British inquisition’ into the deal. Director general Simon Walker warned of the ‘growing politicisation’ of the deal.","Pascal Soriot told MPs yesterday that Pfizer takeover could cost lives .

Business Secretary Vince Cable said there was a ‘major national interest’ at stake, but warned of ‘legal consequences’ if the Government tried to intervene in the deal; . Pfizer had launched a direct appeal to Astra’s shareholders in a bid to persuade them to sell up. City experts predicted Pfizer would launch an improved ‘knockout’ offer for Astra within days."

A driver has clocked up a record 45 penalty points on his licence in a nine-month offending spree yet is still on the road, damning new figures reveal today. The motorist, from Liverpool, got the points for eight offences of either failing to disclose the identity of the driver or for speeding between October 1 2012 and June 20 2013. His total exceeded the previous record of 42 points according to the Institute of Advanced Motorists (IAM) which obtained figures from the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) following a Freedom of Information Act request. A driver has clocked up a record 45 penalty points on his licence in a nine-month offending spree yet is still on the road (stock picture) Drivers who get 12 points within three years can be disqualified. But the new figures show that nine drivers have clocked up 30 points or more. And more than 7,000 have 12 points or more. The new official Government figures have outraged motoring groups and road safety campaigners who say it makes a mockery of penalty points system, bringing it ‘into disrepute’. They say the ministers at the Department for Transport and Ministry of Justice must act to clamp down on the scandal which is leaving potentially dangerous drivers unpunished on the nation’s roads. The IAM said poor communication between the Government’s DVLA and the courts - particularly when drivers clocked up repeat points over a short time - and a tendency for courts to take ‘hardship’ stories into account means thousands of drivers are still on the road despite exceeding the 12-point limit. The figures obtained by the IAM showed: . The figures have outraged motoring groups and road safety campaigners who say it makes a mockery of penalty points system . Failing to give the identity of the owner, speeding, and driving uninsured were the most common reasons for points, said the IAM. Normally a driver facing 12 points will be subject to an automatic six-month ban - unless they can prove it would cause exceptional hardship. A court decides if a driver is banned or has special reasons to be allowed to stay behind the wheel. The DVLA said courts can exercise discretion and not disqualify in a small percentage of cases where a driver has accumulated 12 or more points. Some drivers given points for failing to disclose the driver had argued that a series of different people had test-driven their the car ahead of a sale and they didn’t know who was at the wheel at the time of the offence, said the IAM. The figures show nine drivers have clocked up 30-plus points. And more than 7,000 have 12 points or more . The issue of who was driving when an offence is committed is controversial and can escalate. HM Courts & Tribunals Service say the ‘vast majority’ of drivers who get 12 or more penalty points are fined and disqualified from driving but notes: ‘Magistrates can use their discretion to not enforce a driving ban if doing so would cause exceptional hardship, such as losing a job or the ability to care for a dependant. A fine will still be enforced. Only a very small number of cases are affected by the data-sharing issue and we are working closely with DVLA to improve this.’ A DVLA spokesman said: ‘The DVLA’s role is to record the information provided by the courts. The courts are able to use their discretion to decide whether or not to disqualify a driver.’","Motorist, from Liverpool, got the points for eight offences of either failing to disclose the identity of the driver or for speeding .

The Volkswagen Passat Estate SE Business 2.0 TDI 150PS (pictured) is the eighth generation of the model . BAD . The Passat has been around for 42 years, pictured here is the first generation of the model in 1973 .","The Passat has been around for 42 years, the first model came out in 1973 . The estate car is the fourth biggest-selling VW in the UK . The new model has everything from keyless entry to heated seats . Only diesel models will be on sale initially and there will be a beefed-up 4x4 version hitting the road in July . It's hard to believe, but the Passat has been around for 42 years. More than 22 million have been made since 1973. So this is the eighth generation. It's a proven and indefatigable workhorse — the fact that the estate version comfortably outsells the svelte saloon testifies to that. Brits bought 10,000 estates in 2013, against 7,600 saloons. The Passat is the fourth biggest-selling VW here after the Golf, Polo and Up!. Used as much for work as for leisure and pleasure, these estates can take a pounding. This new version really does look and feel like the business, but is it more than just a pretty face? It certainly has kerb appeal with elegant styling. Even the doorman at a fivestar London hotel — more used to parking Ferraris, and Bentleys — was moved unprompted to comment on how smart it looked. Goes from rest to 62mph in 8.9 seconds — and feels faster as you go through the six-speed manual gearbox. Top speed is 135mph. Five driving modes include comfort, normal, sport or 'eco'. I kept it mainly on sport and enjoyed plenty of power when needed, yet with a nimble, well-balanced ride on all types of road. Excellent economy. It averaged 68.9mpg — 76.3mpg when cruising and 59.9mpg around town. CO2 emissions are a low 107g/ km. An even more frugal 78mpg BlueMotion version arrives in June. A stop-start system helps keep fuel bills low. There's keyless entry, plus and heated seats and steering wheel for which, in this cold snap, I was very grateful. Ample flexible interior space; slightly more than in the outgoing model, even though its exterior dimensions are slightly smaller. The three rear seats fold nearly flat for extra load lugging capability. Smart but unfussy interior, with supportive seats that have plenty of reclining and setting options to ensure comfort for drivers and passengers of all shapes and sizes. Stylish cloth fabric on the seats with silver inserts also add to the business-like feel. Easy to drive and intuitive to a degree that means you quickly become at home. Five trim levels from launch: S, SE, SE Business (my vehicle), GT and R-Line. The latter two include a range topping two-litre bi-turbo TDi diesel engine with 240 bhp and four-wheel drive. From £22,215 for the saloon, but add on £1,530 for the estate. Lots of electronic kit to keep you safe and stable on the road. Easy-to-read dials, but VW plans an optional 12.3 in display to replace the conventional instrument cluster. Rear cameras make reversing into the tightest of spaces much easier. There may be a lot of technology on board but it's simply displayed on an uncluttered dashboard. The touchscreen is relatively easy to navigate. For anyone keen on the great outdoors, a 'trailer-assist' feature helps to manoeuvre trailers more accurately. Only diesel models are on sale at first. A frugal plug-in hybrid GTE version with a 1.4-litre TSi petrol and electric motor version is to follow in October, promising a combined range of more than 620 miles or 31 miles in pure electric mode. A beefed-up 4x4 version will hit the road in July. Extras hiked the base price of the version I drove from £26,665 to £31,270. These included the winter pack of heated front seats, windscreen washer jets (£280), heated steering wheel (£135), heated windscreen (£150), and a whole lot more. The dynamic chassis control (£700), 18-inch anthracite alloys (£665), sound insulating glass (£310), climate control (£590), all-round cameras (£590), and a system that enables you to connect your smartphone to the car's information and entertainment system (£160)."

Considering changes: Spain head coach Vicente Del Bosque saw his side lose 5-1 to Holland . VIDEO All Star XI: Andres Iniesta . Opta stats: . Main man: Barcelona forward Alexis Sanchez leads the line for the Chileans .","Spain take on Chile in both sides' second Group B match . Holders Spain could go out if they lose after being thrashed 5-1 by Holland . Chile beat Australia in their first game and could go through with a win . Chile have never beaten Spain in their 10 previous encounters (D2 L8). Spain have won the two previous meetings with Chile at the World Cup: in 1950 (2-0) and in 2010 (2-1). The game in 1950 was played at the Maracanã; which is where this encounter is taking place. Chile have lost their two previous World Cup games against the defending champion, both against Brazil (in 1962 and 1998). In their group opener against the Netherlands, Spain conceded 5+ goals in an international for the first time since losing 6-2 to Scotland in June 1963. Only once before had Spain conceded 5+ goals in a World Cup game (1-6 vs Brazil in Brazil in 1950). Spain lost their opening game of the 2010 World Cup finals (0-1 v Switzerland) but became the first team to ever lift the World Cup trophy after having lost their opening game of the tournament. Spain’s 1-5 defeat to the Netherlands was the heaviest margin of defeat by a reigning World Cup champion in the history of the tournament (four goals). The previous heaviest were Brazil losing 0-3 v France in 1998 and West Germany losing 3-6 v France in 1958. Alexis Sanchez has been involved in seven of the last eight goals that Chile have scored (six assists and one goal). Spain have not lost back to back internationals since October 2006 (2-3 v Northern Ireland and 0-2 v Sweden). The Spaniards conceded more goals in 90 minutes against Netherlands (5) than they had in their previous nine international matches combined (4). Spain have won just one of their last five internationals played at a neutral venue (L2 D2) and that victory was a 2-0 win over El Salvador (FIFA Ranked 68th) in Washington earlier this month."

Here is all the information you need for the first game in Group F between Argentina and Bosnia-Herzegovina . Venue: Estadio Jornalista Mario Filho, Rio de JaneiroKick-off: 11pm (7pm, Brazil time)TV coverage: BBC1, from 10.30pmOdds: Argentina 4/11, Draw 7/2, Bosnia-Herzegovina 17/2Referee: Joel Aguilar, El Salvador . Backing their boys: Argentina fans will hope to see their country win the World Cup in Brazil . Managers:  Alejandro Sabella (Argentina) and Safet Susic (Bosnia-Herzegovina)Key clash: Lionel Messi v Emir Spahic . The Barcelona forward scored in his first meeting with Spahic, when the defender played for Sevilla in 2011. Spahic, 33, will not even be able to just focus on Argentina’s talisman, with Sergio Aguero and Gonzalo Higuain joining the four-time Ballon d’Or winner to make up a potent front-three. One to watch: Angel di Maria (Argentina) Outstanding for Real Madrid this season, di Maria’s role for his national side is equally important. Not only is the 26-year-old capable of gliding past defenders and chipping in with goals, he also has the discipline to track back and help his side defensively. This will be particularly important given Argentina’s potential weakness at the back. Head-to-head record: Played 2 Argentina Wins 2 . Threat: Angel Di Maria could be one of Argentina's danger men . Team News: . Lionel Messi takes centre stage in the World Cup on Sunday, facing Bosnia-Herzegovina in the Maracana with dreams of returning to the stadium for the final in four weeks' time. Argentina arrive in Rio with expectations running high, not least that Messi will produce the kind of displays that were absent in South Africa four years ago. Argentina have a wonderfully-talented attack, so much so that coach Alejandro Sabella could afford to leave Carlos Tevez out of his squad - but there are still question marks at the back, something readily admitted by Maradona, coach in 2010. That attacking strength is however causing a dilemma for coach Sabella. The coach has admitted that he favours a 5-3-2 formation - but he used a 4-3-3 set-up during the successful qualifying campaign, choosing not to squander his firepower. However, there have been indications in training this week that he is going to be more conservative against Bosnia, which means Gonzalo Higuain missing out. Much, of course, will depend on Messi but Bosnia coach Safet Susic's insists he has no plans to man-mark the four-times world player of the year. This will be Bosnia's World Cup debut, indeed their first major tournament having only played the first match as an independent nation in 1995 following the civil war and break-up of Yugoslavia. Argentina defender Federico Fernandez says they are acutely aware of the threat of Manchester City striker Edin Dzeko. Tough test: Lionel Messi is likely to be marked by Bosnia-Herzegovina's Emir Spahic .","Argentina are one of the favourites to win the World Cup . Bosnia-Herzegovina are making their debut at the World Cup . Lionel Messi is set to provide a threat for the South Americans . Argentina have won nine and lost just one of their last 12 World Cup group games (D2), scoring 24 and conceding just four in total in this run. La Albiceleste have only mustered two wins in their last nine World Cup games against European sides, drawing four and losing three. Bosnia-Herzegovina are the only country making their World Cup debut in 2014. Since 1950, the best record for a side making their debut is third, achieved by Portugal in 1966 and Croatia in 1998. Lionel Messi has only scored one goal in 571 minutes of World Cup football. Indeed only one of his 31 shots in the tournament has found the net. Argentina have won both previous internationals against the Dragons (both friendlies), scoring seven and conceding none. Alejandro Sabella’s side scored more goals than any other South American side in qualifying (35). No player was involved in more goals than Edin Dzeko in the European qualifiers (14 – 10 goals, 4 assists). Dzeko and compatriot Vedad Ibisevic both scored four headed goals in qualification; the strike partners scored all eight of Bosnia’s headed goals between them."

23aead7b1c485889d015c66af0eee5035fa59e49,"A gang of eight Republican and Democratic senators has hammered out an immigration reform deal that could allow 11million illegal immigrants to gain legal status and, eventually, American citizenship. The agreement includes strict enforcement measures like stepped up border security and visa exit tracking that must go into effect before any illegal residents are given official status. The plan is endorsed by conservative newcomers Marco Rubio, of Florida, and Jeff Flake, of Arizona, as well as liberal veterans Charles Schumer, of New York, and Dick Durbin, of Illinois. The senators hope that the broad range of political ideology in the group - from Tea Party darlings to established progressives - will make the plan palatable for both Republicans in the U.S. House and President Barack Obama. Scroll down for video . Come together: This is the gang of eight senators, four Republicans and four Democrats, who have introduced a series of immigration reforms they hope could pass both the U.S. House and President Barack Obama's desk . The U.S. - Mexico border Field State Park separates the cities of San Diego and Tijuana . A second bipartisan group in the Senate has also introduced a plan to double the number of U.S. visas for highly-skilled legal immigrants in the hopes of luring more leaders in math, science, engineering and technology to the United States. 'First of all, Americans support it, in . poll after poll,' Sen Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, said on . 'ABC's This Week with George Stephanopoulos' on Sunday. 'Secondly, . Latino voters expect it. Thirdly, Democrats want it. And fourth, . Republicans need it.' The senators are expected to formally announce the their proposals today, though details have already been leaked to the public. The deals include: . Lawmakers say immigration reform is 'set to be passed this year.' Sen. John McCain, pictured, is part of a six-member bipartisan Senate group working on the legislation . Obama promised Hispanic voters that he would make immigration reform one of his top priorities in his second term. He plans to give a major immigration policy speech in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Tuesday where he will lay out his own plan to reform the system. However, immigration reform is also seen as a political necessity by an increasing number of Republicans. Obama won 71 percent of the Hispanic vote in the 2012 election, compared with Republican Mitt Romney's 29 percent, according to exit polls. Hispanic voters were decisive in his victories in the key battleground states of Florida, Colorado and Nevada. Many moderate leaders of the GOP are calling for the party to shift its harsh stance on illegal immigration and allow a 'pathway to citizenship.' 'Look at the last election. We are losing dramatically the Hispanic vote, which we think should be ours,' Arizona Sen John McCain, who has long campaigned for immigration reform, told 'This Week' on Sunday. An Army National Guardsman looks out over the U.S.-Mexico border in Nogales, Arizona . Moderates Republican like McCain argue that most Hispanic voters are socially conservative and would shift their political allegiances if the GOP changes its stance on immigration. However, the Senate deal reflects the reality that most Republicans view a 'pathway to citizenship' as an amnesty that incentives for illegal immigration. Sen Rubio, a Cuban-American who is a rising star in the Republican party, insisted that illegal immigrants 'be required to go to the back of the line' before obtaining citizenship. He, and other conservatives, argue that immigrants who came to the country legally should have preference. Many Republicans in the group insisted on tightening immigration controls before any before any of the citizenship rules took effect. A group of border-state law enforcement officials and policymakers will have to certify that border security has been tightened. Sen. Marco Rubio said the senate is making 'significant progress' Additionally, the Department of Homeland Security must develop a better exit control system to track foreign visitors and ensure the country knows which ones have overstayed their temporary visas. According to some studies, 40 percent of illegal immigrants arrive in the country legally, but do not leave when their visas expire. The proposal puts more onerous citizenship restrictions on illegal immigrants than most Democrats support, however, the Senate group is hoping the tough proposal will help win over votes in the U.S. House. The Republican-controlled House remains the greatest obstacle in Washington to passing a law that would allow a 'pathway to citizenship.' Conservatives in Congress have scuttled numerous bills that would grant legal status to illegal immigrants, under both Obama and President George W Bush.","Four Republicans and four Democrats have agreed to a plan that would step up enforcement, but also provide a 'pathway to citizenship' Deal has support from conservatives and liberals in the Senate .

Revised guidance for health care workers treating Ebola patients will include using protective gear 'with no skin showing,' a top federal health official said Sunday.

After weeks of chasing the story, Chief Sports Reporter Matt Lawton discovers Cardiff have sent a dossier to the FA, claiming former Cardiff City manager Malky Mackay and Crystal Palace Sporting Director Iain Moody had exchanged ‘racist, sexist and homophobic’ texts and email messages. With the final piece of his investigation falling into place, Lawton contacts all parties for comments. Sky Sports News reports that Mackay, who was expected to be named as the new Crystal Palace manager, has pulled out of the running to replace Tony Pulis. Moody’s lawyers attempt unsuccessfully to stop the Daily Mail from publishing the allegations. The Daily Mail publishes the exclusive story. Shortly after, former Cardiff City midfielder Ibrahim Farah takes to Twitter to label Mackay ‘disgusting’ and to complain about his treatment at the hands of Mackay. Moody resigns from his role at Crystal Palace. Leading football figures and anti-bigotry campaigners welcome the story, and call for swift action if allegations are substantiated. Early in the evening, Mackay’s agent speaks to Sky Sports News, saying the former Cardiff manager is shocked by the allegations and will fight them. Later in the evening, the League Managers Association issues an apology on Mackay’s behalf. Mackay denies allegations he is a racist and claims only ‘two’ of the text messages in question were sent by him. The ill-judged statement tries to dismiss the sordid exchanges between the two men as ‘friendly text banter’. Twitter responds by pouring scorn on the statement, with prominent former footballers Jason Roberts and Stan Collymore leading the criticism. Sportsmail publishes further details, with Lawton pointing out that, contrary to Mackay’s claims, the former Cardiff manager was reponsible for both racist and homophobic texts. Rio Ferdinand publicly criticises the LMA as ‘disgraceful’ and ‘insensitive’.

Cardiff also call for the LMA’s chief executive Richard Bevan to resign.

Scandal: North Wales chief Mark Polin revealed details of the sex abuse investigation, which involved at least 140 victims over 30 years . One of Britain’s biggest child abuse scandals is likely to have been even larger than previously thought, police revealed yesterday. Dozens of former residents of North Wales children’s homes have given detectives ‘graphic’ accounts of appalling abuse at the hands of 84 staff – most of whom have never been prosecuted. Barely a decade after a £13million public inquiry that was meant to uncover the extent of the scandal, police yesterday revealed they had ‘significant’ new evidence of ‘serious and systemic’ abuse. Home Secretary Theresa May ordered the new inquiry after allegations on the BBC’s Newsnight programme last November that a public inquiry which looked at the scandal had failed to uncover the full extent of the abuse. The now-notorious Newsnight film led to Tory grandee Lord McAlpine being wrongly implicated in the abuse. In their first major progress report yesterday, officers who have been sifting through the accounts of former residents of the homes revealed the appalling scale of the suspected abuse. And they warned that abusers who believed they had evaded justice should for ever be ‘looking over their shoulders’ in fear of arrest and prosecution. The Waterhouse Report of 2000 heard from 650 witnesses and led to the conviction of seven former care workers. The report, by former High Court Judge Sir Ronald Waterhouse, said sexual and physical abuse mainly focused on six council-run homes and two private homes between 1994 and 1990. Yesterday, however, Detective Superintendent Ian Mulcahey, who is leading the new investigation, Operation Pallial, revealed: . Scroll down for video . Probe: Police say a new inquiry has found that sexual abuse at North Wales care home homes, including Bryn Estyn in Wrexham (pictured), was much worse than first thought . Report: Details uncovered by the new inquiry were revealed by (l-r) Det Sup Ian Mulcahey of Merseyside Police and North Wales chief constable Mark Polin at a press conference today . Previous: High Court judge Sir Ronald Waterhouse previously looked at abuse in North Wales but today's findings show the situation was much worse than first thought . The investigation is running in . parallel with a review of the Waterhouse Inquiry by Mrs Justice Macur. Many ex-residents of homes including the notorious Bryn Estyn, near . Wrexham, have long argued that Waterhouse’s terms of reference – . focusing on abuse within the properties – meant claims of links to a . wider paedophile ring in the area were ignored. But the bombshell claim by Steve . Messham to have been abused by Lord McAlpine was discredited when he was . belatedly shown a photograph of the former Tory treasurer and conceded . he had named the wrong man. The furore last November led to the resignation of BBC director general George Entwistle after just 54 days in charge. Officers working on Operation Pallial . have made one arrest so far. A man was held in Ipswich last week and . then bailed. More arrests are expected. Among those who have given their . accounts of being abused to the new inquiry is Keith Gregory, who was a . Bryn Estyn resident from 1972-74 and is now a local councillor. None of his alleged abusers were . prosecuted, but he has given detectives the names of four he is prepared . to testify against and predicted more ex-residents would now come . forward.

Ray Massey (pictured) tests the features on the new seven-seater Land Rover Discovery Sport in Iceland . BAD .","The fantastic flexibility of features makes this car great for families . The car is highly rated with more emergency braking and stability control . Only the 2.2 litre SD4 diesel version will be on sale in the UK . Just in time for the Christmas break, I took the handsome new seven-seater Discovery Sport to Iceland — no, not the High Street frozen food chain, but a proper epic across ice and snow-covered landscapes on that Viking island south of the Arctic Circle. We may have been promised a disco inferno near the still-smouldering volcanoes, but it was more like Ice Station Zebra on the road. I've never seen so many fur-clad parkas since a screening of the Mod film Quadrophenia. This was no road test for sissies. I don't recall meeting any tarmac outside Reykjavik. Most of the crosscountry driving was on thick ice, thin ice, or snow. There was a constant threat of blizzard when, I'm told, visibility drops to nil. Thankfully the winter tyres and onboard safety features were up to it. On looks alone it's a winner. It may be a replacement for the Freelander, but it's bigger, smarter, more luxurious and flexible, even though the engine and much of the underpinnings remain the same. Great for families, thanks to fantastic flexibility. There are five seats for everyday use. But two extra ones pop up from the rear to create a magnificent seven. The willing 2.2 litre SD4 diesel is linked to a smooth 9-speed ZF automatic gearbox and accelerates briskly from rest to 62mph in 8.4 seconds so it's pretty nimble around town and when cruising, as well as off road. Top speed is 117mph. CO2 emissions are a fair 161g/km, helped by a 'stop-start' system. There's the option of manual override via paddles on the steering wheel. And boy did I use them as I traversed slippery glaciers and stormed up steep, snowclad hills. For winter in Britain, it'll do the job. The hill-descent control was a godsend. It takes control of the low gearing and braking to give you a reassuringly confident descent. It's been built with about 2ft (600mm) of wading depth, with a short overhang at the front and rear to help you cross shallow rivers and fords. The car has achieved the top 5-star rating with more emergency braking and stability control systems than you could wave a stick at — plus a pedestrian airbag. A comfortable and comforting interior with a commanding view of the road ahead and ample head and legroom in the back. It goes on sale on January 22, with first deliveries set for late February. Not the cheapest 4x4 by far and the 'extras' will soon mount up. You are paying a hefty premium for the badge and the engineering expertise behind it. Only the 2.2 litre SD4 diesel version will be on sale in the UK, no petrol option. There will be a 'greener' two-wheel-drive version soon, producing a 119g/km and costing less than £30,000. Great for looking the part, but frankly if you're going to buy a proper Land Rover, why have one that's not a 4x4? The hill descent control button needs to be more prominent so you could whack it into play in transit — when you suddenly realise you need it — rather than groping to find it."

A gynaecologist who stood behind a patient and groped her breasts claimed it was how he had been taught to do an examination at medical school in India. Dr Angamathu Arunkalaivanan put the woman through ‘three years of hell’ after he carried out a ‘sexually motivated’ examination during an appointment at a private hospital. The married practitioner, who goes by the name of Dr Arun, denied he was at fault and insisted it was how he had been instructed to check breasts while training in Madras. But the 49-year-old patient sought independent advice about whether the way she had been examined was inappropriate. After her suspicions were confirmed the woman, identified as patient A, contacted the police who referred the case to the General Medical Council. BMI Edgbaston Hospital where Dr Arun worked. The married practitioner denied he was at fault . Yesterday the Medical Practitioners’ Tribunal Service in Manchester found Dr Arun, 48, guilty of misconduct . and suspended him for a year. The doctor, who has an NHS post as . consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at Birmingham City Hospital, . was also found to be at fault for failing to offer a chaperone or make a . record of the breast check in the patient’s notes. The . panel was told how during the consultation in October 2010 at BMI The . Edgbaston Hospital in Birmingham, Dr Arun asked the woman to lift up her . top and bra, before cupping and squeezing her breasts with both hands . from behind. Patient A told the hearing she still ‘beats herself up’ for . allowing herself to be ‘sexually assaulted’. She . said: ‘I left the room that day and I just ... it just felt so wrong. I . could just not get the examination out of my head and I actually said, . “What just happened in there?” ’ Describing . the doctor’s response to her complaint, she added: ‘He didn’t deny . anything I said. He said that’s how he was taught in India.’ She told . the panel she was so disturbed she could not even bring herself to tell . her husband. The panel . was told that Dr Arun, who qualified from the University of Madras in . 1988, had been questioned over the incident by director of nursing Pat . Munday. He agreed with the patient’s description of what happened, but . said it was the way he had been taught at medical school. The patient was told this by Mrs Munday and offered an apology from the doctor, but felt this was not sufficient. She contacted another breast screening centre, which told her that what she had experienced was not normal, so she went to the police. Panel chairman Sandra Sturdy told Dr Arun: ‘The panel accepted that this is an isolated case and that the breast examination was clinically indicated. ‘However, the manner in which you conducted the breast examination on Patient A was clearly sexually motivated. Your conduct ... amounted to serious misconduct.’ Announcing his suspension, she said it would be ‘disproportionate’ to strike him off the medical register, which would ‘deprive the public of the benefit of your medical services’. On 6 March 2014 the High Court heard an appeal by Mr Arunkalaivanan against the findings by the panel that he had carried out an inappropriate breast examination and that he had been sexually motivated in doing so. The judge concluded Mr Arunkalaivanan had not been sexually motivated, and quashed his suspension.  However, she upheld the tribunal’s conclusion that he had carried out an inappropriate breast examination and sent the matter back to the tribunal for it to decide whether Mr Arunkalaivanan should receive a warning over the examination and his admitted failure to ensure a chaperone had been present. On 1 September 2014 the tribunal decided that while Mr Arunkalaivanan had carried out an inappropriate breast examination and failed to discuss the need for a chaperon, these departures from good medical practice were part of an isolated incident involving a practitioner of previous good character with a career history of 20 years. It also noted that Mr Arunkalaivanan had tried to apologise to the patient and had taken steps to remedy his breast examination technique.  The tribunal decided that the public interest did not require a warning.

Prince Charles will demand a total overhaul of the honours system when he becomes king. The heir to the throne believes gongs are handed out ‘to the wrong people for the wrong reasons’. He is said to want to scrap honours such as the CBE, which stands for Commander of the Order of the British Empire. Modern and egalitarian awards would be brought in instead, possibly in smaller numbers. ‘Why should people still be invested with an order of a defunct British empire?’ one member of the prince’s inner circle told the Mail. Charles, who stood in for the Queen at an investiture yesterday, also thinks the honours ceremonies should be a celebration. A figure close to him said a party would be more suitable, adding: ‘It’s a shame that after receiving an honour at the palace, recipients have to leave. How much more appropriate it would be for the occasion to be marked by a party.’ The startling insight into the thinking of a prince often accused of meddling in national affairs was among many offered by aides who have spoken to the Mail for a remarkable series, beginning today. A major biography is also being published which claims the Prince of Wales wants to reshape not only the monarchy, but the country itself when he accedes to the throne. In a previously unpublished interview with the author, the prince says he is determined to fix the ‘battered’ world. ‘I only take on the most difficult challenges. Because I want to raise aspirations and create hope from hopelessness and health from deprivation,’ he says. Catherine Mayer, editor at large for Time magazine, was given unprecedented access to the prince, as well as his closest friends and advisers at Clarence House, for the first semi-authorised biography in years. She describes Charles as a man ‘set to reshape the monarchy in his own image’ and one who ‘will never be remote and silent like his own mother’. Miss Mayer’s book also: . A biography to be published next month claims the Prince of Wales wants to reshape not only the monarchy, but the country itself when he accedes to the throne . Even though its text is largely complimentary, the timing of the book is not ideal for Charles and his team. Next month the Supreme Court will rule on whether 27 ‘black spider memos’ written by the prince to ministers airing his views on issues of national importance should be published. Senior aides are resigned to the fact that Charles is likely to lose his decade-long battle to keep the notes secret and are preparing themselves for the fallout. The court ruling will be followed by a BBC documentary shedding light on the ‘War of the Wales’ and efforts by the prince’s staff to undermine Diana. The new biography offers a different view, sensationally referring to Diana’s attempts to ‘spread word about her husband’s derelictions’. It says: ‘His camp fought back, but without the same skills and hampered by a principal who could never match Diana’s lustre or her bloodlust.’ One member of his inner circle told the Mail: ‘Does he meddle? Yes, sometimes. Is he misguided on occasions? Possibly. But does he do it for the best of reasons? Absolutely. He is a very good man and what he does comes from a good place.’ The book by Catherine Mayer, editor at large for Time magazine, examines Princess Diana’s ‘bloodlust’ for revenge against Charles and Camilla (pictured together in 2002)","When king, Prince Charles will demand an overhaul of the honours system .

Amongst males the figure dramatically increases to almost half of black males and nearly 40 percent of white males, which can have a negative impact on their ability to find work, go to school and participate fully in their communities. The study analyzed national survey data from 1997 to 2008 of teenagers and young adults and their arrest histories, which ranged from truancy and underage drinking to more serious and violent offenses. Minor traffic violations were excluded. Almost half of black males have been arrested by the time they are 23 according to a new study released in the Crime & Delinquency journal on Monday . This is the first report since the 1960s on how the risk of arrest varies across race and gender, said Robert Brame, a criminology professor at the University of South Carolina and lead author of the study. The study's most striking finding is the variance amongst males of different races: . Nearly 40 percent of white males have been arrested by the time they are 23, which can have a negative impact on their ability to find work, go to school and participate fully in their communities . ‘A problem is that many males – especially black males – are navigating the transition from youth to adulthood with the baggage and difficulties from contact with the criminal justice system,’ said Brame. The negative impacts can be great, he said. ‘Criminal records that show up in searches can impede employment, reduce access to housing, thwart admission to and financing for higher education and affect civic and volunteer activities such as voting or adoption. They also can damage personal and family relationships.’ The research also looked at arrest rates amongst females, although unlike with their male counterparts there was little variation between races. The report found that: . Brame says the next step is to develop an understanding of the economic, social and law enforcement factors that can influence arrests and what role gender and race play. The report found that by age 23, 49 percent of black males, 44 percent of Hispanic males and 38 percent of white males have been arrested . 'As a society, we often worry a great deal about the effects of children watching television, eating junk food, playing sports and having access to good schools,' said Brame. 'Experiencing formal contact with the criminal justice system could also have powerful effects on behavior and impose substantial constraints on opportunities for America's youth. 'We know from our two studies that these experiences are prevalent and that they vary across different demographic groups. 'Going forward it will be constructive to support systematic studies into the sources of these variations and to continue efforts to understand the effects of criminal justice interventions on sanctions on future behavior.'","A third of Americans have been arrested by the time they are 23 according to a new study released in the Crime & Delinquency journal on Monday .

Ibrahim was hit in the shoulder by one of a number of bullets fired at him on his way home in Macquarie Street in Sydney's CBD. After his release from jail, where he served six years for manslaughter, the younger brother of Kings Cross nightclub identity John Ibrahim had reportedly started a new relationship and became embroiled in a life of partying. Scroll down for video . Convicted killer Michael Ibrahim (left) was shot on a footpath just metres from NSW Parliament House on Sunday night.  He is the brother of Kings Cross identity John Ibrahim (right) The Sun Herald reported that Ibrahim, 36, had been seen at Cafe Del Mar in Darling Harbour, and the 'floating beach club'. Sources reported Ibrahim had used his new freedom to reconnect with a south-Western Sydney crime figure, before the relationship soured and the man's family intervened. Despite the alleged attempt to ease tensions, animosity escalated between the pair, before Ibrahim was hospitalised by the shooting. Ibrahim's brother, Kings Cross nighclub identity John Ibrahim, visited him in hospital, and the 36-year-old has been sitting up and in good spirits in a stable condition, said hospital spokesman David Faktor on Monday afternoon. Mr Faktor said the patient had not undergone surgery, correcting earlier information.

Apart from the man's gunshot wound, police have received no further reports of injuries. The shooting took place outside a multi-storey office building at 151 Macquarie Street - just 200 metres away from NSW Parliament House and less than 300 metres from the scene of the Lindt cafe siege in Martin Place.

He was granted parole, reportedly subject to a range of strict conditions, including electronic monitoring and keeping away from Kings Cross and other parts of Sydney.

An independent Scotland could be an economic disaster, triggering financial instability and significant spending cuts, Vince Cable warned yesterday. In a stark assessment, the Lib Dem Business Secretary suggested Scots would have to pay VAT on food and face higher stamp prices, while they would also be hit by currency chaos and isolation from Europe. And he predicted Royal Bank of Scotland, which has been based north of the border since 1727, would move to London. Way out? Royal Bank of Scotland could be force to abandon its Edinburgh HQ to move to London in the event of independence, Vince Cable claimed . It . is just the latest high-level intervention amid growing fears of the . impact of a ‘yes’ vote in the referendum on Scottish independence on . September 18. Bob Dudley, . chief executive of BP, this week became the first business leader to say . Britain is better off in its current form, saying: ‘My personal view is . Great Britain is great and it ought to stay together.’ Business Secretary Vince Cable also raised doubts about Scotland joining the EU, and warned it could mean VAT being added to food and children's clothes . And last week, Bank of England governor Mark Carney warned that Scotland could never be fully independent if it keeps the pound. During . an hour-long grilling by MPs on the Business Select Committee, Mr Cable . revealed his concerns about the consequences of an independent Scotland . on the everyday lives of Scots and the day-to-running of local . businesses, suggesting: . On . RBS’s likelihood of staying in Scotland, he said: ‘If you were managing . RBS, you could almost certainly want to be in a domicile where your . bank is protected against the risk of collapse. ‘I . think they already have a substantial amount of their management in . London. I would have thought that inevitably they would become a London . bank.’ He also raised his . doubts about the ‘depleting resources’ from the North Sea oil reserves, . and the impact that this would have on Scotland’s finances. There are fears billions of pounds in trade between Scotland's financial services sector and the rest of the UK will be threatened by independence . Mr Cable said: ‘It is very difficult to see how this couldn’t avoid quite severe cuts in public spending.’ He . also drew attention to the ‘very high level of worry about what an . independent Scotland would look like’ among Scottish business leaders. After the hearing, a spokesman for Scotland’s Finance Secretary John Swinney dismissed Mr Cable’s comments as ‘ridiculous’. He . said: ‘The pound is as much Scotland’s as it is the rest of the UK’s, . and the fiscal commission working group, with experts including two . Nobel laureates, have concluded that it’s in the interests of both . Scotland and the UK to continue to retain sterling in a formal monetary . union.’ The Chancellor George Osborne has already cast doubt on whether a currency sharing arrangement would be possible. Last . night, an RBS spokesman said it is ‘monitoring the independence debate’ and said it remains ‘politically completely neutral’.","Warns it will be hard to join the EU and food could be hit by VAT . Scottish government dismisses comments from Lib Dem as 'ridiculous' Also predicted RBS - based north of border since 1727 - will move to London . the ‘zero rate’ of VAT in the UK on essentials such as children’s clothes and most food might disappear. Scotland’s financial services may be banned from selling Isas, the . hugely popular tax-free savings accounts, because they are ‘a UK . product’. Stamp prices . might rise due to the huge cost of delivering letters in Scotland, which . has some of the most remote areas in the UK. Post offices, which are heavily subsidised, would also be under threat . because ‘quite a high percentage of the remote post offices that are not . commercially viable’ are in Scotland.

Now all James Harris, who rose to fame as Kamala the Ugandan Giant in the 1980s, has left from those days as a pro wrestler on the national stage are his memories. And with his continued optimism in the face of nightly dialysis, a tragic family story and mounting bills to pay, Harris hopes to put those memories down on paper in an autobiography called Kamala Speaks. Rise and fall: James Harris, aka Kamara the Ugandan Giant, once wrestled WWF headliners like Hulk Hogan, but has since lost his legs to diabetes and is living in rural Mississippi in poverty . Named ironically, since his cannibalistic character spoke only in grunts in the ring, the tome is the focus of a Kickstarter donation drive. After all, as Harris recently told Bleacher Report, 'Life is worth living.' But that doesn't mean there hasn't been heartache. The Mississippi native lost a parent at the tender age of 4 when his father was killed during a game of dice. To date, he's also lost his sister to murder, a son to AIDS and his mother. it appeared that Harris, who recalls sometimes having nothing to eat but discarded bones from the butcher as a child, was going to skirt what looks a lot like a family curse when he was discovered by the WWF in 1982. Kamala was actually a 6-foot-7 Mississippi native, but he terrified audiences as an 'Idi Amin-inspired' African cannibal who often took on legends like Andre the Giant in the 1980s and the Undertaker in the 1990s. His character didn't speak and was accompanied by a keeper named Kim Chee (left) Harris saw great success in the pro wrestling world, but says he was paid only a tiny fraction of his banner name opponents . He quickly rose to fame as the silent, shirtless cannibal from afar--whose 6-foot-7 frame and girthy build struck fear in children and adults alike--accompanied by a man named Kim Chee. That man, whose real name is Kenny Casanova, is the mind behind his Kickstarter and book. Casanova believes Harris--who has a 9th grade education--lost out the soaring salaries of WWF headliners like Hogan and the Undertaker and is now paying the price. 'If I had been a better talker, if I'd have known how to negotiate, that probably would've helped me,' Harris told Bleacher Report. Today, Harris lives on a meager government check following the loss of both his legs to years of diabetes. And his wife has recently been laid off from her job of nearly 30 years. 'I figured Kamala's story alone in book form could be one answer to lost earnings,' Casanova writes on the Kickstarter page. If written correctly, it could mean great supplemental income for Kamala for years to come. So, I picked up the phone and made the call.' Kamala speaks: In order to right what he sees as a wrong, Kim Chee AKA Kenny Casanova, decided to try to help Harris earn a few bucks by telling his unbelievable life story in a biography . Old friends: 'Many HUGE wrestling names came together to provide quotes, stories and additional content for this project, to help create an autobiography like you have never read before,' Casanove writes in his Kickstarter page for the biography project . Today, the book is done and--like Harris himself--tries to focus on the positive. The biography of Harris focuses on, according to Casanova's Kickstarter page: . And, as Harris says: . 'Don't feel sorry for me, If you want to, encourage me. Embrace me. I'm going to be all right—just like I've always been.'","6-foot-7 Mississippi native James Harris once wrestled headliners like Hulk Hogan and Andre the Giant as Idi Amin-inspired African cannibal Kamala .

e1d67d2d9226e8f83e0f85b32e504a9752d51edf,"Ex-Prime Minister Tony Blair faces being called to give evidence in Parliament about the letters to on-the-run IRA suspects . Tony Blair faces being called to Parliament over a secret deal with Sinn Fein which allowed suspected IRA bombers to avoid prosecution. The former Prime Minister is set to be summoned by the Northern Ireland select committee to explain the controversial 'comfort letters' sent to on-the-run suspects telling them they were not being sought by the police. MPs are warning that if he fails to appear there will be 'bad publicity'. The policy led to the collapse of the trial of suspected Hyde Park bomber John Downing in March. The peace process plan agreed between Sinn Fein and Mr Blair's Labour government saw around 200 letters of assurance sent to on-the-runs telling them they were not wanted by UK authorities. The letters did not rule out future prosecutions if new evidence emerged. The Northern Ireland committee is investigating the deal after the collapse of the case against Downey, who was accused of the 1982 IRA Hyde Park bombing which killed four soldiers. In May last year Mr Downey was arrested at Gatwick Airport and charged with killing Squadron Quartermaster Corporal Roy Bright, Lieutenant Anthony Daly, Trooper Simon Tipper and Lance Corporal Jeffrey Young. Seven horses were also killed in the attack as the soldiers travelled from their barracks to Buckingham Palace. But the case against Mr Downey collapsed after it emerged he had received a letter clearing him to travel to the UK. The committee has taken evidence from senior police officers in Northern Ireland, and Labour politicians who served as Northern Ireland Secretary in the Labour government. Mr Blair is understood to have provided written evidence to the committee, but could be called to appear in person to answer questions direct from MPs. IRA suspect John Downey walked free from court in March after the Hyde Park bomb trial collapsed . Committee chairman Laurence Robertson told the Sunday Telegraph: ‘Mr Blair has not found a date in his diary. ‘We are going to have to press him. Technically we can compel him to attend. ‘I don’t want to have to get to that point yet but others on the committee will want to do that. ‘There is going to be bad publicity … if he doesn’t come because people will draw their own conclusion. ‘I take the view Mr Blair has a duty to come and explain it. He is right at the thick of it.’ Mr Blair’s office has previously suggested the sticking point has been finding a suitable date to fit in with his role as a Middle East peace envoy and when the committee is sitting. A spokesman for Mr Blair said: 'Tony Blair has already given evidence in person to the Hallett Review and has said he is happy to also give evidence to the Committee, we are in discussions about the best way to do that given the current demands of his Middle East role.' The spokesman said they did not know anything suggestions Mr Blair could appear via video link. On Thursday the results of another inquiry into the affair, led by Lady Justice Heather Hallett, will be published. Lady Justice Hallett's report is expected to address secret negotiations between Mr Blair and Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, on how to deal with ""on-the-run"" suspects. Because they had not been convicted, they did not fall within the scope of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, which saw jailed paramilitaries released early.

Back in action: Liverpool striker Luis Suarez (right) returns from a knee injury . One to watch: Edinson Cavani . With all the talk being about Suarez’s return to the side, not so much thought has focused on the presence of £55million striker who will partner the Liverpool forward. Cavani was far from his best against Costa Rica but will be desperate to prove he can perform on the big stage and with Suarez will provide a handful for England’s back four. Key clash: Luis Suarez vs Gary Cahill . Suarez had very little joy against Cahill’s Chelsea this season – ending up on the losing side twice and failing to score against the England centre back. Uruguay have rushed their talismanic striker back into the side but he still lacks full fitness and Cahill will hope that will make his task a little easier against the Premier League’s top scorer.

England won 2-1 thanks to goals from Peter Crouch and Joe Cole. England have scored in each of their last eight World Cup encounters with South American sides. Uruguay played twice in São Paulo the last time the World Cup was held in Brazil (1950), drawing 2-2 against Spain and winning 3-2 against Sweden. England recorded their highest ever World Cup pass completion rate (91%) in the opening match vs Italy (1966-2014). Daniel Sturridge has scored three goals in his last four appearances for England. Wayne Rooney is yet to score a World Cup goal. This will be his 10th game, if he plays. Rooney created more chances than any other player in the England vs Italy game (3, including one assist). Uruguay continued their run of not winning an opening group game since 1970 and they have won only once in their second game in their last six World Cup appearances. Uruguay have picked a red card in two of their last four games at the World Cup. England have never conceded 2+ goals in three successive World Cup games before."

Citizens Advice is issuing a warning today after revealing that one in six of the consumer problems it has investigated associated with Gumtree was a scam or potential scam. Police are receiving around 250 crime and fraud allegations a week that are connected to the site, some of which involve serious thefts and assault. Criminals are using the online small ads site Gumtree, which allows people to sell everything from cars to mobile phones and even pets, to steal millions of pounds from innocent consumers . And figures from the National Fraud Intelligence Bureaux reveal online shopping and auction scams were the most common fraud reported in 2013, costing UK consumers £63.6 million. Gumtree is particularly vulnerable because the website does not vet or take identification details from its users, which means it can be used time and again by criminals who are difficult to trace. The website is owned by eBay, which does have ID checking but is also vulnerable to criminal scams, according to research by Citizens Advice. It said one in ten problems it has looked at associated with eBay was a scam or potential scam. The watchdog gave the example of a flat hunter who saw a property advertised on Gumtree and handed over £1,650 to the person he thought was the landlord. However, when he tried to move in, someone else was already living there. In another case a man bought a car on eBay for £360 and spent another £700 on repairs, however it was then repossessed because the previous owner had failed to pay off an outstanding loan. However, this is just the tip of the iceberg and there is evidence from a large and growing number of court cases and police reports that criminals use Gumtree to: . Citizens Advice looked at problems reported to its offices in the six months to the end of March which concerned products or services bought through Gumtree and eBay. There were 649 cases related to Gumtree and 3,711 to eBay. Victims of online crime are invited to report the case to Action Fraud, which collects the details and passes some of them on to local police forces. However, this regime has fallen into disrepute because many victims, some of whom have lost huge sums, are never contacted by the police. The chief executive of Citizens Advice, Gillian Guy, said: ‘Online marketplaces are at risk of becoming a hotbed for scams. ‘These sites are an important service for buyers and sellers, but con artists are profiting from them too.  Scammers are swindling people out of out of hundreds or thousands of pounds by posting false products and services online. ‘Con artists are preying on those still trying to get back on their feet from the recession. Fake jobs and phoney homes are taking people’s deposits that they strived and saved so long for. ‘Businesses need to get savvy to these spurious practices and take steps to stop consumers falling foul of scams. Gumtree is particularly vulnerable because the website does not vet or take identification details from its users, which means it can be used time and again by criminals who are difficult to trace . ‘It’s time for online marketplaces to up their game and do more to protect their customers from dodgy dealings by strongly policing their websites, carrying out spot checks and immediately removing any risky ads.’ Gumtree said: ‘We do everything in our power to keep scammers off our site and encourage anyone that has fallen for a scam, to report it to us and the police. ‘Gumtree is an open platform which provides a free and easy way to buy and sell, meaning we do not track user information. We are always looking at new ways to improve customer safety such as improving methods of communication between us and our customers. ‘We encourage all our users to adhere to our safety tips on the site and discourage people from transferring any money in advance of seeing an item for sale.’ eBay questioned the validity of the research. It said that the 371 cases examined by Citizens Advice should be put in the context of the fact the UK version of the auction site receives 19million visitors each month. It said: ‘eBay invests millions of pounds each year doing just what the Citizens Advice Bureau recommends: strongly policing our website, carrying out spot checks and immediately removing any risky ads.  Customers who purchase on eBay are covered by the eBay Money Back Guarantee and get the item they ordered, or their money back.’","Citizens Advice revealed that one in six of the consumer problems it has . investigated associated with Gumtree was a scam or potential scam .

New signings James Rodriguez and Toni Kroos set to feature for Champions League winners Real Madrid . The winner of the last 11 European Super Cups has alternated between the reigning Champions League winners and the reigning UEFA Cup/Europa League winners. With Bayern Munich winning last season, Sevilla must win the 2014 edition for this trend to continue. Real Madrid are the only team to lose a European Super Cup to a golden goal; they were beaten 2-1 by Galatasaray in 2000. The last UEFA Super Cup to feature two teams from the same country also featured Sevilla; they beat Barcelona 3-0 in the 2006 edition. Sevilla were also the last Spanish side to lose this game; they were beaten 3-1 by Milan in 2007. The last four Spanish sides to qualify for this competition have won. Real Madrid have won only one of their three previous European Super Cups. They were beaten in 1998 and 2000 before beating Feyenoord 3-1 in 2002. Iker Casillas started the 2000 and 2002 games. The last 13 La Liga meetings between Real Madrid and Sevilla have seen 64 goals scored; an average of just under five per game. The Whites have won nine of their last 11 meetings with the Andalusian side in all competitions, but have lost the last two away from the Bernabeu (both away league games). The one previous clash in a major European competition came in the 1958 European Cup quarter-final. Los Merengues won 8-0 at home before drawing 2-2 away to progress. Welshman Gareth Bale scored two goals and assisted two more in two league appearances against Sevilla last season. Cristiano Ronaldo has scored 16 goals in nine La Liga games against Sevilla; he has scored more goals against them than any other side in the competition. James Rodriguez could make his first competitive appearance for Real Madrid in this game. He scored six goals in five World Cup 2014 appearances, collecting the Golden Boot in the process. Keylor Navas made more saves than any other La Liga goalkeeper last season (160) and also had the best save percentage of any regular keeper (80.1%)."

37f956763436e8dfa674846ccfcca56e51ee90ac,"In the dock: Teacher Stephen Bowers (outside Leeds Crown Court) has been accused of raping a 15-year-old pupil after he discovered she had a crush on him . A teacher allegedly raped a 15-year-old pupil he knew had a crush on him by reading her diary, a court heard yesterday. Stephen Bowers, 35, started a sexual relationship with the girl, kissing her in the school store cupboard and later taking her virginity at his house, a court was told. The illicit affair ended abruptly when he allegedly had sex with her against her will, again at his home. The girl claims Bowers forced himself upon her in his bedroom even though she told him she didn’t feel well. She did not tell the police until eight years later, following a confession to a counsellor. The sexual relationship began in 2004 when she was a year 9 pupil at the secondary school in West Yorkshire where Bowers taught English. He was popular and regarded as ‘cool’ – singing in a student band and taking pupils to concerts. Bowers became aware of the girl’s feelings for him when she left her diary in class and he found it. He went on to a website used by pupils and wrote a poem called ‘Star Girl’ in which he referred to the diary and admitted his feelings for her. The girl replied by sending him an internet message. He later replied saying he loved her, she claimed. The alleged store cupboard encounter came in April 2004 – ‘the first time we touched each other’, she said. On another occasion he is said to have rescued her from town centre bullies and taken her to his parents’ empty house. She said he took off her bra and they kissed passionately. Although they were disturbed by a relative of Bowers, the girl, who is now in her 20s, said the sex sessions continued at his home in Leeds. Popular: A jury at Leeds Crown Court (above) was told that Bowers was regarded as 'cool' by pupils as he allowed them to call him Steve, was in a band with three other students and took pupils to see gigs . ‘I don’t particularly remember being . pressured into it because I believed I was totally in love with this guy . and he was amazing,’ she said. ‘He was an English teacher and he kind . of had a way with words. To me we were in love and it was going to last . forever.’ Describing their first time together, she said: ‘He had never . had sex with a virgin before and he told me he was quite excited. ‘It was totally consensual at that point. Even though I knew it was wrong in the eyes of the law I thought the law was wrong.’ The alleged rape happened in autumn . 2004 at Bowers’ house. She said they watched a film and ate a pizza . before having consensual sex. Later when Bowers wanted sex again she told him she wasn’t feeling well, she said. The court heard that Bowers told her: ‘You really don’t want this do you?’ Adrian Strong, for the Crown, said of . the rape allegation: ‘The prosecution say Stephen Bowers took advantage . of that vulnerability and forced sex upon her.’ Bowers was arrested in March last year but did not comment in police interview. Mr Strong said the defendant’s case . was likely to be that there was no intimate contact with the girl, that . he was aware of a crush on her part but nothing happened between them. Bowers, of Ackworth, West Yorkshire, denies rape and three charges of sexual activity with a child. The trial, at Leeds Crown Court, continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Stephen Bowers, 35, 'started secret relationship with girl at his school' 'Kissed her in storeroom then went to his parents' house for sexual contact' 'Later forced himself on her when she refused sex because she was ill' Prosecutor tells trial: 'Bowers took advantage of that vulnerability' Bowers denies rape and three counts of sexual activity with a child . Mr Bowers was found not guilty of all charges.  In May 2014, the Disclosure & Barring Service (DBS) decided that it was not appropriate to include Mr Bowers in the Children’s Barred List or the Adults’ Barred List. However, on 19 September 2014 the Secretary of State for Education barred Mr Bowers for life from teaching children after the Professional Conduct Panel of the National College for Teaching found on 17 September on a balance of probabilities that he was guilty of professional misconduct, including having sex with Pupil A “on one or more occasions while she was under the legal consensual age”."

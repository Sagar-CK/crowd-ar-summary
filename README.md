Code repository for the experimental design setup for my Bachelor's Honors Project.

# Miscellaneous Notes
- Add error handling everywhere!

# Client TODO
- Timed Out Completion Code (+ functionality)
- Add a global timer that will time out the user after 30 minutes.
- Make sure we store once the user redirects to the completion code page?

# Server TODO
- Ensure that the server keeps track of the articles that have been given to users. (For reruns if people back out)
